        <ul>
          <li class="row1">&#10065; buy vs. build is a continuum
          <ul>
            <li class="row0">&#10065; When you buy, you end up having to pay someone to customize it -- especially in government
            <ul>
              <li class="row1">&#10065; vendors sell nationally and internationally</li>
              <li class="row0">&#10065; in this audience you&#39;re concerned primarily with national and especially state laws</li>
              <li class="row1">&#10065; even when you buy you are also paying for custom software -- the theory is that you pay less because the basic application already handles the common cases</li>
              <li class="row0">&#10065; for complex systems you probably are also paying for training and documentation</li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            <li class="row1">&#10065; When you build your cost is all developer salaries or consulting fees</li>
            <li class="row0">&#10065; It&#39;s actually hard to tell which of those extremes is more cost effective
            <ul>
              <li class="row1">&#10065; Both models require similar up front investment of time to investigate potential solutions</li>
              <li class="row0">&#10065; The proprietary vendors will take you out to lunch.  Probably no one in the open source project will be doing that.  You have to judge for yourself if the lunch they buy you is worth the hour of your undivided attention they get in exchange.</li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            <li class="row1">&#10065; Open source lands squarely in-between those extremes
            <ul>
              <li class="row0">&#10065; you start with an existing code base which has been fairly well tested in some real-world applications</li>
              <li class="row1">&#10065; in many cases it isn&#39;t very well documented and training may be hard to come by -- the cost is in the time it takes your developers to learn to use the tool on their own, or paying some consultant to do the training</li>
              <li class="row0">&#10065; some dimensions of your problem will be well addressed or even solved by these tools -- same story as if you bought a commercial application</li>
              <li class="row1">&#10065; but it hasn&#39;t been deployed in your particular application</li>
              <li class="row0">&#10065; you will find things in the code that don&#39;t work for your application without some customization</li>
              <li class="row1">&#10065; you can code around the limitations in your own code as you would with any 3rd party solution</li>
              <li class="row0">&#10065; you can also change their code so it works right for your problem</li>
              <li class="row1">&#10065; give your changes back
              <ul>
                <li class="row0">&#10065; if you give your changes back to the project and the project accepts them, others will benefit from your pain</li>
                <li class="row1">&#10065; you won&#39;t have to take on the additional pain of maintaining your patches separately from the open source source tree.</li>
              </ul>
              </li>

          <li class="row0">&#10065; taking license - GPL, LGPL, BSD, MIT, Apache, Artistic
          <ul>
            <li class="row1">&#10065; Example of Apple Computer
            <ul>
              <li class="row0">&#10065; Darwin is the unix underbelly of MacOS -- it uses a Mach Microkernel and all the unix command line utilities are derived from the BSD unix family.  </li>
              <li class="row1">&#10065; One major reason Apple chose BSD rather than Linux is about the licensing.  Linux is licensed under the GPL which has a viral clause in it -- any derived code must also be released under the GPL.  By contrast the BSD family lives under a BSD license which allows you to redistribute the code under other licensing terms if you so choose -- that is more business friendly.  </li>
              <li class="row0">&#10065; Apple&#39;s legendary ease of use still lives in proprietary source code and single-vendor hardware.</li>
              <li class="row1">&#10065; Apple enjoys the benefit of years of production-tested code from the BSD family while still keeping enough of their code proprietary to provide compelling reasons for customers to buy Apple hardware.  Also, as the BSD crowd find and fix bugs in their utilities, Apple can incorporate those fixes without having to pay for all those developers&#39; salaries and benefits.  </li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            <li class="row0">&#10065; JBoss vs. Geronimo example
            <ul>
              <li class="row1">&#10065; JBoss is LGPL -- you can build apps to run in JBoss without restriction, but if you want to release anything derived from JBoss it must also be licensed under LGPL</li>
              <li class="row0">&#10065; Geronimo is Apache 2.0 -- modify and release it under other licenses, but give credit to the copyright holders </li>
            </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
          </li>
          <li class="row1">&#10065; about the cost
          <ul>
            <li class="row0">&#10065; there are no license fees</li>
            <li class="row1">&#10065; but, you do have to invest time to learn something new</li>
            <li class="row0">&#10065; keeping up with the latest version gives the benefit of code maintained by someone else, but there&#39;s still work in keeping up</li>
            <li class="row1">&#10065; if you choose not to keep up with the latest version, there may still be work in maintaining your own patches to the code.</li>
