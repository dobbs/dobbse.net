<p>As I left the house this morning, my mind was racing over concepts of finance that I&#39;d watched last night.  <a href="http://itc.conversationsnetwork.org/shows/detail4386.html">Jon Udell interviewed Salman Khan</a> about education and screencasting in his work on <a href="http://khanacademy.org">http://khanacademy.org</a>.  Their conversation began with thoughts about using a minimalist approach to produce tutorials on a vast array of subjects.  They moved on to exciting conversations about education and technology.  I spent some time watching a few of the videos... surprised to find that some among that collection were directly relevant to some of the work I do for <a href="http://www.bivio.biz">bivio</a>.  My mind was buzzing about present value and his spreadsheet model for analyzing the question of buying a house vs. renting.  I was daydreaming of other possibilities for the software he&#39;s created to quiz people on math concepts: <a href="http://khanexercises.appspot.com/">http://khanexercises.appspot.com/</a>.  I was thinking about how I might do something similar around my work on perspective, or around the lessons I&#39;ve learned about software development and software business from Rob.  I was thinking a little about how I might simplify whatever it is I want to tell about <a href="http://www.ralph-miller.org/">Ralph Miller</a>, Sarah&#39;s Grandfather.</p>

<p>Then I snapped out of my inner world and noticed the space I was in.</p>

<p>The sun was brilliant on the snow as I walked to work this morning.  Each crunchy step along the sidewalk carried my eyes through shimmering veils, twinkling rays of sunlight reflecting off of the snow from every direction I turned.  The sparkly blanket was striped with the startling visual quiet from the shadows of trees and shrubs.</p>

<p>The inner and outer landscapes were equally beautiful and exciting.  I&#39;m glad to have been lost in thought and equally glad to have been found in the moment.  At least some people I know would disagree.  If you have not been enchanted by mathematics and software, I&#39;m sorry for the beauty you&#39;re missing.  And regardless of that question, I hope that you see the beauty where ever you are right now as well as the beauty inside you.</p>
