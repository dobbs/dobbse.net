<p>What to do with 18 to 24 inches of snow in the yard?  When I shovel our driveway, I always pile the snow up on the lawn, especially when it&#39;s good packing snow.  This heavy wet storm... fantastic stuff.  Last night, I decided to take one more pass at the driveway before the heavy wet snow froze overnight.  Usually I&#39;m thinking about getting some much needed water to our trees.  Last night I was thinking about Halloween and Elliott&#39;s recent interest in mazes.  Inspiration took hold of me and I spent an extra hour making a labyrinth with the Great Pile as the destination.</p>

<p>Not sure how long the thing will last under the attention of an energetic four-and-a-half-year-old on a snow day.  But at least I have some pictures to show for it.</p>
