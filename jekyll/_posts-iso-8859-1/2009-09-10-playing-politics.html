<p>Hey Politican!  I&#39;m not moved when you whine about the other politicians <strong>playing politics</strong>.  You say it with such conviction, but did you really miss that part of the job description when you were campaigning for office?  Is it really a surprise?</p>

<p>Didn&#39;t think so.</p>

<p>In that case, do you really think I believe you&#39;re the good guy, or the innocent victim of wicked politics and they&#39;re the bad guy, the cynical politician?</p>

<p>You may be underestimating our cynicism about the nature of your business.</p>

<p>(Just in case it&#39;s not obvious, I&#39;m looking at <span class="caps">BOTH</span> of you, Barack Obama and Dick Cheney.  Not that you were talking about each other, but I&#39;ve heard both of you whining exactly this way.)</p>

<p>I&#39;m sure the rabid democrat agrees when a democrat accuses a republican of playing politics.  I&#39;m equally sure that the rabid republican agrees when a republican accuses a democrat of playing politics.</p>

<p>I&#39;m pretty sure that most of us in the middle, left or right of center, see through this rhetorical flourish as a bunch of <a href="http://dobbse.net/thinair/2004/07/finger-pointing.html">finger pointing</a> that reveals as much about the accuser as it does the accused.</p>
