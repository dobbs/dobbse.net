<p>Last week, it finally dawned on me that I&#39;m involved in the creation of <a href="http://dobbse.net/thinair/2008/09/race.html">a new elementary school</a>.  My heart aches to see educational technology and <a href="http://dobbse.net/thinair/2008/09/computational-thinking.html">computational thinking</a> pervasively interwoven with education.  Imagine something beyond teaching kids to use computers or software or the Internet.  How can computation change the way we teach kids to think and learn?  What opportunities do computers offer that are impossible without them?  How can these opportunities be embedded within the architecture itself?  More than just a background for the play, let the building perform as an actor.  Let computation also be transformed: more than just screens, keyboards, mice and Internet connections, can we envision something better than an interactive television?</p>

<p>I&#39;m so excited to be involved in the project.</p>
