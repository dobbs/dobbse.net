<p>Whenever I sit down to write I always start telling how it all happened.  Some chain of events lead me to want to write and I can&#39;t do anything until I&#39;ve described each link.  About an hour later I notice that I&#39;ve carefully written and re-written a lot of stuff, links to articles and related material.  I have scattered text files of initial thoughts on related topics I should flesh out someday.  And I have written nothing about the topic itself.  In the remaining ten minutes I scratch out hasty, half-baked cruft or an outline of what I really wanted to publish.  When do I ever find more than an hour to write?</p>
