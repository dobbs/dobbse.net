<p>Point your finger at someone.  Go ahead.  Make the pointing shape with your hand and hold it out there in front of you.  Now look closely at your hand and consider the following expression.</p>

<blockquote><p> Be careful about pointing your finger at someone else because there are three fingers pointed back at you.</p></blockquote>

<p>Namely your very own little finger, ring finger, and middle finger are pointed at yourself while your index finger is pointed at the target of your accussations.  With that image in mind...</p>

<blockquote><p>So I had a choice to make: Either take the word of a madman, or defend America. Given that choice, I will defend America every time.</p></blockquote>

<p>Those who oppose W&#39;s re-election are defending America too.</p>
