Classic postcard morning for the first day of Spring here in Boulder.  Winter <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/news/archive/2003/03/20/national1248EST0702.DTL">went out with a bang</a> this year.  <blockquote>Rollinsville, Colo., perched at 9,000 feet above sea level in the foothills northwest of Denver, got 7 feet, 31/2 inches. </p>

<p>The east Denver suburb of Aurora recorded 40 inches of snow. Boulder got 22.5 inches.</blockquote></p>

<p>Unfortunately, I-70 is still closed west of Morrison.  Although, with that much snow, it's probably good that I can't ski myself into an avalanche.  Occasionally -- it seemed more frequent when I was younger -- Mother Nature reminds Colorado residents to just chill out for a couple days.  I think blizzards are more gentile than earthquakes, tornados, floods, or hurricanes, but no less awesome and humbling.</p>
