<p>In <a href="http://www.starwars.com/episode-i/">The Phantom Menace</a>, Yoda says:<blockquote>Fear is the path to the dark side. Fear leads to anger. Anger leads to hate. Hate leads to <strong>suffering</strong>. I sense much fear in you. </blockquote></p>

<p>Much fear in the world, I sense.</p>
