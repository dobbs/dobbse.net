<p>The pun is intentional.  While I have been getting acquainted with the code I am taking over for my new contract, I have also taken advantage of the the trial license for <span class="caps">IDEA.  </span>The app is using Struts in JBoss, both of which are new to me.  You can expect to see some Struts-Turbine comparisons as I get more familiar.</p>

<p>Today I started <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?TestDrivenProgramming">test-driving</a> some new code in the data access object.</p>

<p>My very first impression of Struts this week was frustrating.  Hunting from the struts-config.xml to the objects and <span class="caps">JS</span>Ps annoyed me.  At some point I will probably grok the need for the extra layers of indirection.  This week it just bugged me.  And then I installed <span class="caps">IDEA.</span></p>

<p>I learned regular expressions from <span class="caps">BB</span>Edit and quickly became an evangelist for both.  In the past three years, I have become an emacs junkie.  I&#39;ve never been impressed with any <span class="caps">IDE,</span> always returning to the comfort of the all-mighty text editor.  I&#39;ve read plenty of accolades for <span class="caps">IDEA,</span> but remained skeptical.  In the first ten minutes, after setting up the project, I was ready to spend the money.</p>

<p>Setting up the project was intuitive.  I didn&#39;t read the docs at all -- and didn&#39;t even notice that until I started writing about it today.  I read through a few tips-du-jour and left it on.  <span class="caps">I </span><em>never</em> do that!  The tips are entirely relevant.</p>

<p>What I noticed first was the todos extracted from the comments in the code.  Not a wiz-bang thing, but incredibly and immediately useful.  (Contrast that with the <span class="caps">MS </span>Paperclip.)</p>

<p>Next I noticed the local version control.  I first used <span class="caps">CVS</span> for a safety net in my hobby projects.  I have missed that since I joined Turbine and learned to never commit if it doesn&#39;t compile.  In the back of my mind I have occasionally toyed with trying a local repository in conjunction with the real thing, I have chosen to just do without.  I had forgotten about it until I saw the feature in <span class="caps">IDEA.  I</span> immediately had to see the diff and rollbacks in action.  How totally excellent!</p>

<p>Most importantly, in these few days I haven&#39;t found any annoyances.  That never happens!  Preferences have been easy to find.  Keyboard access for everything is excellent.  Ubiquitous name completion and JUnit integration are also excellent.  I love having the &quot;grammar checker&quot; warn me about the syntax errors <em>before</em> I compile.  My only challenge is training my fingers new keystrokes.</p>

<p>Back to Struts, <span class="caps">IDEA</span> was immediately useful in loading classes by name while looking at struts-config.xml.  It took away the nuisance of the indirection.  I realize now that this is one of the critical services offered by an <span class="caps">IDE</span>:  making layers of indirection easy to navigate.</p>

<p>I know the refactoring goodies are cool, but fluidly navigating the code is what facilitates the understanding that comes before code changes.</p>

<p><span class="caps">IDEA</span> rocks!</p>

<p>Yeah, I feel the same way about IntelliJ. It compares well with JBuilder 7..10, execept that the motd's are *really* usefull.</p>

<p>JBuilder still works better for me, but it's no longer worth the high cost, especially considering the rate of development. Today I'd probably settle for IntelliJ.</p>
