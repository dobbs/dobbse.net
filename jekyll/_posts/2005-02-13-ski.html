<p>I&#39;ve been a downhill skier for about thirty years.  I don&#39;t often brag about it because I don&#39;t think I&#39;m as good as I should be after so much time.  My performance has been all the more disappointing having lived most of those thirty years only an hour or so away from world-class skiing.  I don&#39;t really have much of an excuse.</p>

<p>Friday may have been the best ski day in my life.  It is certainly the best day in a decade or more.  A little background is in order.  My ski boots are probably twenty years old.  My skis are more recent -- maybe ten-year-old 203 cm Elans.  For those of you who don&#39;t know, that&#39;s old-school.  I&#39;m way overdue for some new gear.  On Friday I followed through on my new year&#39;s resolution to demo something more modern.</p>

<p>At Mary Jane, when you rent demos they let you change skis as many times as you like.  I started with the <span class="caps">K2 </span>Crossfire, and the Volkl Supersport Five Star, and the Rossignol <span class="caps">B2 </span>Bandit before lunch.  I took one more run on the <span class="caps">B2</span> after lunch and switched to the <span class="caps">K2 </span>Recon.  All of &#39;em were 181 or 182 cm long, except the Recons which were shorter -- 172 cm I think.  Quite a change from the 203s I&#39;m used to.</p>

<p>The short story is that shaped skis are going to change my life.  I was a completely different skier.  I&#39;ll have to try a few more models before I settle on my next pair of skis.  But of the four I tried on Friday I&#39;d definitely choose one of the K2s.</p>

<p>The <span class="caps">K2 </span>Crossfire was a fantastic place to start my day.  I was beside myself with how much fun they were.  On the groomed runs I was carving like a veteran snowboarder would.  I didn&#39;t quite get to the point of laying my hands or shoulders on the snow through the turns, but I was pretty close.  I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever felt anything like it.  Effortless carved turns.  It was a thing of pure joy.</p>

<p>Then I took them in the bumps and found myself about twice as far down the hill before my legs started to burn.  I couldn&#39;t believe I had just skied so far through the bumps without pausing to catch my breath or my balance.  Nor could I believe how much more aggressively I was skiing.  In my 203s I basically panic when I get going as fast as I was in the Crossfires.  I start to loose control and sit back and brake with my poles and various other ugly displays.  On the Crossfires, I was all over the bumps.  I was skiing so much faster than I do in my 203s but never lost control.  I only stopped for the sweet burn in my thighs.  Pure joy.</p>

<p>The Supersport Five Stars were nowhere near as much fun for me.  I couldn&#39;t ski fast enough for them.  Even in the relatively modest crowd on Friday, it was too crowded to let those things loose.  I did get one open run to let &#39;em fly.  They were full of zoom!  Really, really stable and very fast.  But at slower speeds they were a lot like my 203s -- kinda sloppy on the groomed runs and too stiff in the bumps.</p>

<p>The Rossis were pretty much the opposite of the Volkls.  They were too mushy to carve on the groomed runs, but quite fun in the bumps.  I knew they weren&#39;t for me, though.  Not after the tasty carving Crossfire.</p>

<p>It was the end of the day when I got into the <span class="caps">K2 </span>Recons.  They were described as the sister ski to the Crossfire -- a little wider turning radius and probably better in the trees.  I took a quick groomed run and then a long trip through the bumps.  I was pretty exhausted from a full day of skiing and nevertheless had the best bump run I can remember.</p>

<p>&quot;Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.&quot;  On Friday I put on a different pair of skis and it completely transformed my skiing.  I was finally skiing like someone who&#39;d been doing it for thirty years.  Magic.</p>
