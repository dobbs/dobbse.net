<p>I've been bloghopping all day.  I keep stepping away from the keyboard, shaking my head about the time I've poured away.  Each time I asked myself, <em>"Self, what were you supposed to be doing again?"</em>  The original goal was to try to identify some blogs to aggrigate.  Early this morning I managed to get the <a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/~rael/lang/perl/blagg/downloads/plugins/mt.pl">Movable Type plugin</a> working with <a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/~rael/lang/perl/blagg/">Blagg</a>.  That turned out to be a <a href="/thinair/000020.html#000020">simple adjustment to mt.cfg</a>.</p>

<p>Cool beans, I can now aggrigate blogs.  But I immediately noticed that the aggrigated entries all had today's date, undermining some of the cool navigational instrumentation offered by Movable Type.  So I dug into the code for Blagg and <a href="http://www.movabletype.org/">Movable Type</a> to see if I could pull the dates from the RSS feeds and use those in the MT entries.  I ran directly into the <a href="http://weblog.infoworld.com/udell/2002/09/10.html#a408">RSS morass</a>.  Now I understand what all the fuss is about.<br />
<em></p>

<p>   "Self, what do we do now?"</p>

<p>   "RUN, COWARD!"<br />
</em></p>

<p>Rather than joing the RSS battle, I decided that a little patience and judicious use of cron would let me enjoy Movable Type's instrumentation in my aggrigator.  If I aggrigate the feeds daily, they'll be sufficiently in sync for my purposes.  Only this first pull will be hosed.</p>

<p>That's what I did this morning.  Then I decided to figure out which blogs I want to aggrigate.  That's where the Energizer Rabbit started bloghopping.  And kept going and going and...</p>
