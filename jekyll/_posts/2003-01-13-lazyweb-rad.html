<p><a href="http://www.infoworld.com/articles/ap/xml/03/01/06/030106apapps.xml">More wise words to remember</a> from <cite>Jon Udell</cite><blockquote cite="http://www.infoworld.com/articles/ap/xml/03/01/06/030106apapps.xml">If you're creating a Web service that you hope will have a disruptive impact, the lessons are clear. Support HTTP GET-style URLs. Design them carefully, matching de facto standards where they exist. Keep the URLs short, so people can easily understand, modify, and trade them. Establish a blog reputation. Use the blog network to promote the service and enable users of the service to self-organize. It all adds up to a recipe for recombinant growth.</blockquote></p>
