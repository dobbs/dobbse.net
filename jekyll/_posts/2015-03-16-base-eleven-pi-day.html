<p>Today's date, numerically encoded according to US conventions: <strong>3/16/15</strong></p>
<p>The time this article posted (Mounatin Daylight Time): <strong>07:02</strong></p>
<p>Woo Hoo!  <strong>&pi; day all over again.</strong></p>
<p>If you casually ignore the first two digits of the Year of Our Lord.  And ignore that <a href="https://github.com/dobbs/dobbse.net/commit/b711fcfa61dfaae6e5220d5e68b6d429cb5ba449">I actually faked the publication date and time</a>.  And ignore that the Year of Our Lord is at best an approximation.  And ignore that there is no 0 between 1BC and 1AD on The Number line of Our Lord.  And if you ignore that at least 2/3rds of the world disagrees about the "Our Lord" part.  In general you kinda have to overlook that everything about this exciting temporal milestone is layer upon layer of arbitrary human convention.</p>
<p>I mean, except for the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter and the corresponding conversion from a base ten representation of that ratio to the base eleven representation.</p>
<p>But by all means, don't let any of that stop you from celebrating this momentous occasion with a slice of pie.</p>

<p>I'm actually more excited about <strong><a href="https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=convert+2*pi+to+base+8">&tau; in base eight day</a>: 6.2207732504205</strong>.  If you arbitrarily chose a point close to the international date line, you could almost celebrate THAT day on the solstice.  <a href="https://tauday.com/">Tau Day</a>.</p>
