<p>Mark, my wife, Sarah, who is also not at all demanding, says it&#39;s fabulous that <a href="http://diveintomark.org/archives/2003/10/31/the-great-pumpkin">you quote Winnie the Pooh, but you loose points for the demanding bit</a>.  I&#39;ve also just been disciplined for my commiseration.  In addition to the Pooh references <a href="http://dobbse.net/reflection/2002/10/000045.html">I also love the zork references</a>.  My Cube used to be named Grue, until Sarah asked what that was about.  She objected to our dog having to sleep in the same room with a grue.  I explained how very afraid of light they were, that even the <span class="caps">LE</span>Ds on the power strip and ethernet hub would keep a grue at bay.  Nevertheless she routinely gave me That Stare when the name of my computer came up.  I finally renamed it to zork.</p>
