<p>I&#39;ve been trying to play around with <a href="http://drools.codehaus.org">drools</a> in fits and starts for over a year now or maybe longer.  My first exposure to a rule engine was at PlanetCAD.  We were going to integrate Envoy with some code which I mostly didn&#39;t like but had the redeeming quality that they used <a href="http://herzberg.ca.sandia.gov/jess/">Jess</a> for declaring pricing rules.</p>

<p>I wanted to play with Drools, but I just can&#39;t stand the <span class="caps">XML</span> syntax for declaring rules.  It mixes angle-brackets with code blocks.  You can choose a few different languages for use in the code blocks, but it still looks too much like <span class="caps">JSP</span> without <span class="caps">JSTL.  </span>(Bob, aren&#39;t you the one who said &quot;I hate programming in angle brackets&quot;?)  More importantly, I&#39;m just tinkering with this stuff to get my head thinking in rules and Java doesn&#39;t feel like the right language for tinkering.</p>

<p>To that end I have written some code in jython to enable me to play with Drools with a pleasant python syntax.  It&#39;s been kinda fun working on it in small doses after Elliott goes to bed.</p>

<p>I&#39;m pretty amazed at how little code I needed to write.  That could be a good sign.  For your comparing pleasure, I wrote up a couple of the drools examples using my python syntax:</p>

<p>State Example:  <a href="http://drools.codehaus.org/State+Example">drools</a> <a href="http://dobbse.net/thinair/2005/03/drools-py/examples/state.py">jython</a></p>

<p>Fibonacci Example: <a href="http://drools.codehaus.org/Fibonacci+Example">drools</a> <a href="http://dobbse.net/thinair/2005/03/drools-py/examples/fibonacci.py">jython</a></p>

<p>The problem of translating this work to Groovy is left as an exercise for James Strachan.  ;-) A project for the lazy web is to do something similar with Jess.</p>

<p><ins>Update:</ins> Oh, the horror.  Jython 2.1 doesn&#39;t do closures!  The following code works okay in CPython 2.3, but throws an error in Jython:</p>

<pre>
import unittest

def fn_factory(x):
    def fn(y): return x + y
    return fn

class TestClosure(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_fn(self):
        fn = fn_factory(5)
        for i in range(3,10):
            self.assertEquals(fn(i), i + 5, &#39;i=%s fn(i)=%s&#39;%(i, i+5))

if __name__ == &#39;__main__&#39;:
    unittest.main()
</pre><p>There are ways to work around this, but they&#39;re all ugly and the whole point was to get away from ugly.  I was so disappointed as I was debugging this and searching the web for more details.  Sigh.  It&#39;s pretty hard to do without closures once you get used to thinking that way.  The alternatives seem so messy.  A rev of Jython can&#39;t come too soon as far as I&#39;m concerned.</p>
