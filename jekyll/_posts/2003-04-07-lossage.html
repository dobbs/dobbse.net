<p>I don't know who to cuss at!  I was working merrily away on a reply to Charles Miller's post about the Mail.app spam filter.  I was nearly done, just editing for brevity when BAM!  The window disappears.  "What did I just do?"  I checked through all open windows.  Nope.  My reply to Charles was gone.  Data lossage always sucks.  But what did I do?  (Please find the link to Charles' post in my <a href="http://dobbse.net/thinair/2003/04/000101.html">rewritten reply</a>.  Grumble.)</p>

<p>I was typing into a &lt;textarea> in Safari in Movable Type's New Entry form.  One thing I like about Safari is I no longer have to cut-and-paste in order to check my spelling.</p>

<p>But then I hit the keystroke to copy some text.  You know the one.  Command-W.</p>

<p>The mac user asks  "doncha mean Command-C?"   The emacs user asks "doncha mean Meta-W?"  If you use both, maybe you know my pain.</p>

<p>For those of you who don't:  The Quartz window manager maps the Command key to Meta.  So the Meta-W keystroke, which copies a block of text in XEmacs, is Command-W on an Apple keyboard.  And Command-W is the keystroke which closes windows in MacOS.  My fingers don't always make the transition from XEmacs key bindings to MacOS key bindings when I switch between apps.</p>

<p>If I had been using any text editor instead of a damn web browser to compose my reply I would have been prompted to save my work before closing it.  But Safari merrily closed the damn window when I told it to.</p>

<p>I think I'll file that as a feature request:  please make Safari smart enough to recognize a web form.  Identify the window as unsaved if text is edited in any of the fields.  Prompt the user for confirmation before closing a window containing an unsaved form.</p>

<p>But I will probably also go back to composing my blog entries in emacs and cut-and-paste them into Movable Type's form.  If I get really ambitious I'll write an emacs module to submit new entries.  Naw.  Who am I kidding?  It would be easier to switch to blosxom and just upload the entries.</p>
