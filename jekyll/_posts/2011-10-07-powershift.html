<p><strong>Concentrations of Power</strong>.  We take these truths to be
self-evident: imbalance of power invites abuse of power, and power has
tipped wildly out of balance.  The evidence of abuse is widespread and
mounting.</p>

<p><strong>Of the People, By the People, and For the People</strong>.
Abe Lincoln in the Gettysburg Address gave us this myth that our
government was about the People.  The actual institutions have always
been a government of the elite.  The Declaration of Independence opens
with "We the People" but the Constitution divides power between State
and Federal governments.  The People are an afterthought squeezed into
the Bill of Rights.</p>

<p><strong>The S&P and Fortune 500s</strong>.  The world's largest
corporations have grown into stateless governments unto themselves.
We the People have no representation in these corporations.  Our only
influence is how we work or how we spend.  As wealth has concentrated
into the hands off the few, the influence of the People over
multi-national corporations has dwindled.</p>

<p><strong>New Tools of Communication</strong>.  We no longer need
long chains of command and hierarchical organizations to organize and
implement ambitious projects.  We no longer need the talking heads in
the media or political polls to tell us what the People think.  We the
People can speak for ourselves.</p>

<p><strong>Emergence</strong>.  We no longer need the singular vision
of individual charismatic leaders to focus our collective action.  The
new tools of communication empower even very small groups to effect
significant changes and for one small group to adopt and adapt the
successes and failures of others.</p>

<p>We witness a shift of power.  Power never shifts gracefully.</p>
 
<p>We the People are finally catching on that we can govern ourselves
instead of ceeding power to Representatives and we can collectively
relaim power ceeded to multi-national coroprations.</p>

<p>This is gonna be an interesting ride.</p>
