<p>Sarah&#39;s uncle has written a book about his experience in Vietnam as a bombadeer/navigator.  I mentioned him a couple years ago in <a href="http://dobbse.net/reflection/2002/11/000067.html">Veteran&#39;s Day, POW communication systems, and Warfare</a></p>

<p><ins>Update:</ins> I didn&#39;t he had a web site.  <a href="http://welcomeintruder.com/">Welcome Intruder</a> by <a href="http://welcomeintruder.com/author.htm">Captain Robert E. Cleary</a></p>

<p>He will be speaking at the Cherry Creek Tattered Cover tonight at 7:30pm.</p>

<p>From the <a href="http://www.tatteredcover.com/NASApp/store/IndexJsp?s=storeevents&amp;eventId=283974">Tattered Cover announcement</a></p>

<blockquote><p>Vietnam Veteran Robert Cleary will read from and sign Welcome Intruder: Stories From the Logbook of a Marine Naval Flight Officer ($37.50 Robert Cleary). Historically rich with letters, photos, and papers that may now be called the remnants of war, this book serves to highlight the truths about Cleary&#39;s Marine Squadron&#39;s particular contributions to the war. These stories weave a rich tapestry and serve as the collective memory of multiple events and ultimately of the bond shared by men who lost the final remnants of their boyhood in a country far from home.</p></blockquote>

<p>If you live in the Denver Metro Area and are interested, maybe I&#39;ll see you there.  <a href="http://www.tatteredcover.com/NASApp/store/IndexJsp?s=storehours">Tattered Cover hours and locations</a></p>
