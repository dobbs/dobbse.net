Testing cookies in Capybara, Rack::Test, RSpec, and Rails: debugging other people's code (1 of 2)
</a></h1>

<p>
  This morning Sarah and the kids made gingerbread cookies, thoroughly
  destroying all illusions of joyous family fun for the holidays.
  Speaking of cookies failing to deliver promises, I blew the entire
  day Friday figuring out a failing capybara test around browser
  cookies.  Not a good weekend for cookies.
</p>

<p>
  It's a Rails app which depends entirely on a legacy authentication
  and authorization system.  The simplest thing that could possibly
  work is use cookies set by the existing authentication system.
  Should be simple.
</p>

<p>
<pre><code>describe "ServiceRequestController" do
  it "redirects when credentials are missing" do
    get new_service_request_path
    response.status.should == 302
  end
end</code></pre>
</p>

<p>
  Test is red.
</p>

<p>
<pre><code>class ServiceRequestController < ApplicationController
  def new
    redirect_to cookies_path
  end
end</code></pre>
</p>

<p>
  Test is green.
</p>

<p>
<pre><code>describe "ServiceRequestController" do
  ...
  it "renders the form when credentials are found" do
    page.driver.browser.set_cookie 'username=jhendrix'
    get new_service_request_path
    response.status.should == 200
  end    
end</code></pre>
</p>

<p>
  Test is red.
</p>

<p>
<pre><code>class ServiceRequestController < ApplicationController
  def new
    user = LegacyUser.find_by_username(request.cookies['username'])
    if !user
      redirect_to cookies_path
    end
  end
end</code></pre>
</p>

<p>
  Test is red.  I found a work-around just before lunch, but spent the
  rest of the day trying to understand why that doesn't work.
</p>

<h2 id="tldr">tl;dr</h2>

<p>
  If you're here just for the work-around when testing with cookies in
  Capybara and RSpec, here's my first work around (but 
  <a href="http://dobbse.net/thinair/2011/12/capybara-racktest-rspec-cookies-2of2.html#tldr">
    the better way to test cookies in Capybara, Rack::Test and RSpec is in part 2
  </a>):
</p>

<p>
<pre><code>describe "ServiceRequestController" do
  ...
  it "renders the form when credentials are found" do
    page.driver.browser.set_cookie 'username=jhendrix'
    <strong>page.driver.</strong>get new_service_request_path
    response.status.should == 200
  end    
end</code></pre>
</p>

<p>
  Use the <code>page.driver</code> when you call <code>get</code>.
</p>

<h2>Debugging other people's code:  aka. code caving in a maze of twisty passages</h2>

<p>
  What follows are some of the most important programming skills I
  learned working with Rob and Paul at <a href="http://www.bivio.biz/">bivio</a>:
  how to find your way around other people's code.  I'll start with
  the failing test.
<p>

<p>
<pre><code>describe "ServiceRequestController" do
  ...
  it "renders form when credentials are found" do
    page.driver.browser.set_cookie 'username=jhendrix'
    get new_service_request_path
    response.status.should == 200
  end    
end</code></pre>
</p>

<p>
  First question: Am I calling <code>set_cookie</code> correctly?
  There's a profoundly important tone in this question.  Start with a
  beginner's mind.  Don't guess.  Don't be clever.  Just read and
  follow the code.  This is also one of the hardest things to do.  As
  programmers we're all pretty intoxicated with our own cleverness.
  Let go and use The Source.
</p>

<p>
  In RubyMine you can Command-Click on set_cookie or type Command-B.
  That pulls up a list of likely candidates.  Without RubyMine you
  need some unix fu.  Two of the most important, general purpose, and
  language independent programming tools ever are <code>find</code>
  and <code>grep</code>.  Get to know them.  They are your best
  friends.
</p>

<p><code>find ${GEM_PATH//:/ /} -type f -exec grep -nH -e 'def set_cookie' {} /dev/null \;</code></p>

<p>
  Either way you search, the results are similar (though not
  identical).  These are cleaned up from the results via
  <code>find</code> and <code>grep</code>:
</p>

<p><pre><code>
action_dispatch/http/response.rb:158:                   def set_cookie(key, value)
action_dispatch/middleware/session/cookie_store.rb:65:  def set_cookie(env, session_id, cookie)
rack/response.rb:58:                                    def set_cookie(key, value)
rack/session/abstract/id.rb:320:                        def set_cookie(env, headers, cookie)
rack/session/cookie.rb:121:                             def set_cookie(env, headers, cookie)
rack/mock_session.rb:23:                                def set_cookie(cookie, uri = nil)
</code></pre></p>

<p>
  The hits in action_dispatch, rack/response and rack/session are
  probably all related to the real cookie code.  That stuff has to be
  working correctly or no Rails app would be able to save cookies.  It
  almost has to be something in rack/mock_session.
</p>

<p>
  There's a certain bit of irony here.  I didn't trust these search
  results.  I was Being Clever.  I took a longer path and ended up in
  rack/mock_session anyway.  The longer path did give me the
  confidence of a second opinion.  Trusting The Source would have
  produced my answer more quickly.  Then again, I might have found the
  answer and still not trusted it.  I'll share the longer path I took
  which is pretty much what I could learn by stepping through with a
  debugger.
</p>

<p>
  In this call, <code>page.driver.browser.set_code</code> where does
  <code>page</code> come from?  I know it's from Capybara, but where
  exactly?  It'll be in here somewhere: 

  <a href="https://github.com/jnicklas/capybara/tree/master/lib/capybara">https://github.com/jnicklas/capybara/tree/master/lib/capybara</a>.
  <pre><code>cucumber.rb	
dsl.rb
rails.rb	
rspec.rb	
selector.rb	
server.rb	
session.rb	
version.rb</code></pre>

  Looking over that list <code>dsl.rb</code> looked most promising.
  And sure enough in <a href="https://github.com/jnicklas/capybara/blob/master/lib/capybara/dsl.rb">Capybara::DSL</a>
  I find
</p>

<p>
<pre><code>def page
  Capybara.current_session
end</code></pre>  
</p>

<p>
  <code>current_session</code> is defined earlier in the file:
</p>

<p>
<pre><code>def current_session
  session_pool["#{current_driver}:#{session_name}:#{app.object_id}"] ||= Capybara::Session.new(current_driver, app)
end</code></pre>  
</p>

<p>
  Now I know that <code>page</code> is a Capybara::Session using <code>current_driver</code>.  What's <code>current_driver</code>?  It's also defined in <code>dsl.rb</code>:
</p>

<p>
<pre><code>def current_driver
  @current_driver || default_driver
end</code></pre>  
</p>

<p>And <code>default_driver</code>?</p>

<p>
<pre><code>def default_driver
  @default_driver || :rack_test
end</code></pre>  
</p>

<p>
  So <code>page</code> is a <a href="https://github.com/jnicklas/capybara/blob/master/lib/capybara/session.rb">Capybara::Session</a>
  initalized with <code>:rack_test</code>.  The relevant code:
</p>

<p>
<pre><code>attr_reader :mode, :app

def initialize(mode, app=nil)
  @mode = mode
  @app = app
end

def driver
  @driver ||= begin
    unless Capybara.drivers.has_key?(mode)
      other_drivers = Capybara.drivers.keys.map { |key| key.inspect }
      raise Capybara::DriverNotFoundError, "no driver called #{mode.inspect} was found, available drivers: #{other_drivers.join(', ')}"
    end
    Capybara.drivers[mode].call(app)
  end
end
</code></pre>  
</p>

<p>
  Remind me again what it was I was searching for?  I've bounced
  around the code enough to be lost in "a maze of twisty little
  passages, all alike."  Oh yeah:
  <code>page.driver.browser.set_cookie</code>.  After all this
  caving, I'm finally through <code>page</code> and now looking
  for <code>driver</code>.  The good news is, it's right here:
  <code>Capybara.drivers[:rack_test].call(app)</code>.  But where do
  I find <code>Capybara.drivers</code>?  Well given the name, let's look first at the top level capybara module: <a href="https://github.com/jnicklas/capybara/blob/master/lib/capybara.rb">Capybara</a>.
<p>

<p>
<pre><code>def drivers
  @drivers ||= {}
end</code></pre>  
</p>

<p>
  Searching through that file, this is the only line that refers to
  <code>@drivers</code>.  What about references to
  <code>drivers</code> itself?  Here's the only one I could find:
</p>

<p>
<pre><code>def register_driver(name, &block)
  drivers[name] = block
end</code></pre>  
</p>

<p>
  And <code>register_driver</code>?
</p>

<p>
<pre><code>Capybara.register_driver :rack_test do |app|
  Capybara::RackTest::Driver.new(app)
end
</code></pre>  
</p>

<p>
  Now I know the <code>driver</code> is a
  <a href="https://github.com/jnicklas/capybara/blob/master/lib/capybara/rack_test/driver.rb">Capybara::RackTest::Driver</a>
  and the top of that file invites the next question: what's the
  <code>browser</code>?
</p>

<p>
<pre><code>  attr_reader :app, :options

def initialize(app, options={})
  raise ArgumentError, "rack-test requires a rack application, but none was given" unless app
  @app = app
  @options = DEFAULT_OPTIONS.merge(options)
end

def browser
  @browser ||= Capybara::RackTest::Browser.new(self)
end
</code></pre>  
</p>

<p>
  Are we there yet?  What was I looking for again?  Oh, right.  It's
  <code>set_cookie</code>.  But there's no sign of that method in 
  <a href="https://github.com/jnicklas/capybara/blob/master/lib/capybara/rack_test/browser.rb">Capybara::RackTest::Browser</a>.  

  But there is an important bit that's easy to miss right up top:
</p>


<p>
<pre><code>class Capybara::RackTest::Browser
  include ::Rack::Test::Methods</code></pre>  
</p>

<p>
  Let's take a peek in <a href="https://github.com/brynary/rack-test/blob/master/lib/rack/test/methods.rb">Rack::Test::Methods</a>.
  <code>set_cookie</code> is delegated to the
  <code>current_session</code>.
</p>

<p>
<pre><code>METHODS = [
  :request,
  :get,
  :post,
  :put,
  :delete,
  :options,
  :head,
  :follow_redirect!,
  :header,
  :set_cookie,
  :clear_cookies,
  :authorize,
  :basic_authorize,
  :digest_authorize,
  :last_response,
  :last_request
]

def_delegators :current_session, *METHODS
</code></pre>  
</p>

<p>
  <code>current_session</code> points to <code>rack_test_session</code>:
</p>

<p>
<pre><code>
def current_session # :nodoc:
  rack_test_session(_current_session_names.last)
end
</code></pre>  
</p>

<p>
  which points to <code>build_rack_test_session</code>:
</p>

<p>
<pre><code>
def rack_test_session(name = :default) # :nodoc:
  return build_rack_test_session(name) unless name

  @_rack_test_sessions ||= {}
  @_rack_test_sessions[name] ||= build_rack_test_session(name)
end
</code></pre>  
</p>

<p>
  which creates a Rack::Test::Session with a <code>rack_mock_session</code>:
</p>

<p>
<pre><code>
def build_rack_test_session(name) # :nodoc:
  Rack::Test::Session.new(rack_mock_session(name))
end
</code></pre>  
</p>

<p>
  which points to <code>build_rack_mock_session</code>:
</p>

<p>
<pre><code>
def rack_mock_session(name = :default) # :nodoc:
  return build_rack_mock_session unless name

  @_rack_mock_sessions ||= {}
  @_rack_mock_sessions[name] ||= build_rack_mock_session
end
</code></pre>  
</p>

<p>
  "Which will bring us back to" Rack::MockSession.
</p>

<p>
<pre><code>
def build_rack_mock_session # :nodoc:
  Rack::MockSession.new(app)
end
</code></pre>  
</p>
  
<p>
  And inside <a href="https://github.com/brynary/rack-test/blob/master/lib/rack/mock_session.rb">Rack::MockSession</a> is where the test calls set_cookie.
</p>

<p>
<pre><code>def set_cookie(cookie, uri = nil)
  cookie_jar.merge(cookie, uri)
end</code></pre>  
</p>

<p>
  And what, finally, is <code>cookie_jar</code>?
</p>

<p>
<pre><code>def cookie_jar
  @cookie_jar ||= Rack::Test::CookieJar.new([], @default_host)
end</code></pre>  
</p>

<p>
  It's probably a newly minted Rack::Test::CookieJar.  Now wouldn't it
  have been a lot easier if I'd just trusted the search results in the
  first place?  <code>find</code> and <code>grep</code> are your best
  friends.  You can trust them to save you a lot of time.
