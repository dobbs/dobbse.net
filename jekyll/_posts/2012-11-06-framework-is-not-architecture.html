<p>
Allow me to introduce you to the Framework Adoption Antipattern.  And
with it I will share some software history that you youngin's might do
well to learn.
</p>

<figure>
  <ol>
    <li>Get fed up with current tangled mess</li>
    <li>Choose The New Hotness</li>
    <li>Choose a database</li>
    <li>Spend a couple weeks integrating the New Hotness and database with IDE and test infrastructure</li>
    <li>Gradually create a New Tangled Mess</li>
  </ol>
</figure>

<p>
The software industry is built around cycles of new adoption.  The
churn creates an artificial pressure to keep up with the latest and
greatest.  There's always a new hotness.  There's also the illusion
that this time around maybe we'll get started on the right foot.
Maybe <em>this</em> new hotness will not lead us into a tangled mess.
</p>

<p>
For those of us who've been to more than one rodeo, it's a depressing
to watch history repeat itself in the new hotness, just like it did in
the old and busted.  The next wave is super tempting.  Get ahead of
the crowd and you can become the hot shot writing books or speaking at
conferences.  The early adopters always seem like the coolest kids on
the block.  Added bonus, you can ditch the tangled mess you're in and
start fresh.  But <strong>every revolution becomes the new
establishment</strong>.  Which is why we keep going in circles.

<h2>Advice for a young programmer</h2>
<p>
I know how this sounds to you.  I'm just old and crotchety.  I don't
<em>get it</em>.  I'm part of the establishment.  This is a new world.
What you're building is really going to change everything.
</p>

<p>
You're right.  You are going to change everything.  But you will also
learn the truth in the cliche: the more things change the more they
stay the same.  In five or ten years you will look back at what you've
created and see some depressingly familiar tangles.  And there will be
another new hotness.  Your once revolutionary new hotness will grow up
to become the new old and busted.
</p>

<p>
This story is for the long term.  As an industry we still don't know
how to teach what we do.  The only way to learn these lessons is to
join a revolution and experience the transformation to establishment.
This advice-disguised-as-a-story is for programmers starting their
second rodeo.

<h2>Historical background on the path to MVC architecture for web apps</h2>
<p>
Sherman, set the WAYBAC machine to 1995.  It was a momentous year.
Three items launched with particular fanfare: the Internet was
commercialized, Sun released Java, and Netscape released
<del>LiveScript</del> JavaScript.  Perl 5 and python 1 had been
released one year earlier.  The first public announcements of PHP and
ruby were also in 1995.  And the first working draft of XML was in
1996.  All of these things in their respective communities were the
new hotness.  All of them are now the establishment.  I'll also mention that

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_Patterns">Design Patterns</a>

was published in late 1994 'cos it comes into the story later.
</p>

<p>
At the time enterprise computing was dominated by two-tier,
client-server architecture: a fat Windows client connecting to a fat
database.  Over the next few years web applications would be dominated
by Perl CGI and Cold Fusion and its copycats: ASP, JSP, and PHP.  Sun,
IBM, Oracle, WebLogic, BEA and others jumped on the new three-tier
architecture.  They were selling java <em>middleware</em> in hopes of
breaking Microsoft's grip on desktop computing.  Instead of a fat
Windows client, businesses could use the web browser that's installed
with the OS and move their applications onto expensive servers.
</p>

<p>
By the turn of the century, Internet Explorer had nearly won the
browser wars.  Netscape would be bought by AOL in a few years.  On the
server side, Sun and friends were facing backlash against Enterprise
Java Beans (EJBs) and Microsoft started its push to move the ASP
community to .NET.  Sun began evangelizing the Model 2 architecture as
the new hotness: separate the display of content from the business
logic.  <span class="tangent">It was a fashionable pitch at the time:
CSS was promising similar benefits of separating design from
markup.</span>
</p>

<h2>Sun's model 2 marketing and MVC</h2>
<p>
It was right at the turn of the century when our cultural wires got
crossed and we started using the MVC pattern to describe web
architecture.  MVC was a profound innovation in object-oriented user
interface design from Smalltalk-80.  That dash eighty refers to 1980
so we're clear that the pattern was already twenty years old at the
time.  In fact, MVC is used in Design Patterns as an example to help
explain what a design pattern is.  This was a rare moment when the new
hotness was consciously applying lessons from software history.
</p>

<p>
In the final days of 1999, JavaWorld published

<a href="http://www.javaworld.com/javaworld/jw-12-1999/jw-12-ssj-jspmvc.html">Understanding
JavaServer Pages Model 2 architecture</a>.

In May of 2000, Craig McClanahan from Sun, donated a reference
implementation of Sun's Model 2 architecture to the Apache Software
Foundation.  Struts would become the de-facto standard for java web
frameworks.  No question it was a terrific improvement to apply the
MVC pattern to web apps in contrast to the Cold-Fusion-JSP-ASP-PHP
tag-soup model 1.  And yet, and yet....
</p>

<p>
In Sun's marketing and the hype around Struts, Model 2 was described
as an architecture.  In every explanation the MVC pattern was used to
explain the architecture.  And so the Model 2 architecture, the MVC
pattern, and the Struts framework were all conceptually muddled in the
Java community.

<h2>And then Rails was the new hotness</h2>
<p>
Another half-decade later when Rails burst onto the scene, MVC was
taken for granted as the de facto best practice for web application
architecture.  A new generation of programmers were introduced to web
applications and MVC-as-architecture and The Rails Way at the same
time.
</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>What's wrong with MVC and Model 2 for web applications?</h2>

<p>
MVC originally lived in a Smalltalk image, which is sorta like that
virtual machine you have up in the cloud running your modern web
applications.  Only it was a lot less complicated.  Importantly the M
and the V and the C were all living in the same image.  When messages
were passed between the different components in an MVC pattern in
Smalltalk, the messages didn't have far to go.
</p>

<p>
Model 2 by contrast was full of network latency because it grew up
when Sun was trying to sell hardware into the enterprise.  There were
browsers on the desktop and there was middleware running java on
expensive hardware, and then a database (probably Oracle) running on
another bit of expensive hardware.
</p>

<p>
Web frameworks have been contending with two key pieces of friction
for the past decade or so.  On the client side there's the
statelessness of HTTP and on the back end there's the
object-relational mapping to get data back and forth from a pile of
object-oriented business logic on the server into a pile of relational
algebra in the database.
</p>

<p>
MVC in Smalltalk suffered from neither of those key problems.  Data
were persisted within the image right along side the class
definitions, and the View and Controller were in direct and very
stateful communication.
</p>

<p>
Ever since the Model 2 architecture co-opted MVC, Model has come to
mean some object-relational mapping, View is something from the
menagerie of templating languages, and the Controller... Ahh the
controller...
</p>

<p>
Controller as a term is meaningless.  No, it's worse than that.
<strong>Controller is actively destructive</strong>.  I know exactly
what a Controller is, and so do you.  But my Controller is different
from your Controller.  We're using the same word to describe
completely different things.  The only common ground we have is that
we know there's something between the Model and the View.
</p>

<h2>MVC is not an architecture and neither is your framework</h2>
<p>
MVC is a pattern.  It's beautiful and full of wisdom.  It's an
exceptionally good example to teach the principle of separating
concerns.  But the coopting of MVC into an architectural framework
effectively blinded us to the principles and left us with software
dogma.  And such powerful dogma that the Rails revolutionaries
embraced the dogma wholesale even as their rhetoric railed against
excessive ceremony and dogma in the java community.
</p>

<p>
If you looked at a typical rails app you'd think that MVC and
ActiveRecord were the only design patterns you need.  And as
applications have grown from simple foundations in Rails into
enterprise-sized beasts, we hear about developers reaching for Plain
Old Ruby Objects to speed up their test suites.  There's buzz about
refactoring away from fat controllers and fat models.  Rails apps have
become most of what it originally opposed.
</p>

<p>
What's more insidious is the pervasive use of object inheritance in
web frameworks.  Design Patterns has been published for almost two
decades and itself summarized wisdom from the previous two decades of
object-oriented design.  A core principle espoused therein is to
prefer composition to inheritance and yet frameworks continue to
recommend their developers inherit.  This and a database schema is all
you need: <code>class Post &lt; ActiveRecord::Base; end</code>

<h2>Yep, Rails apps are a tangled mess.  Let's switch to the New Hotness.</h2>
<p>
There's a lot of excitement building around javascript these days:
Backbone.js, Ember.js, Node.js, and Meteor are a few examples.
There's buzz around various functional languages: Scala, Erlang,
Haskell, and Clojure, for example.  But really, why bother with the
web anymore when there's Andriod and iOS?  As always there's a lot of
options in the category of new hotness.
</p>

<p>
Nevermind me and my war stories.  Just make the switch and start
drafting talks for the surge of javascript or functional or mobile
conferences.  You can re-invent Rails in a new language as a fast path
to join the next generation of thought leaders.
