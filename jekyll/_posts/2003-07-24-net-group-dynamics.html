<p>Just read Clay Shirky&#39;s <a href="http://www.shirky.com/writings/group_enemy.html">A Group Is Its Own Worst Enemy</a> .  Thanks to Dan Steinberg&quot; for <a href="http://weblogs.java.net/pub/wlg/269">pointing to it on Java Today</a> .  Earlier today I read <a href="http://www.firstmonday.dk/issues/issue8_6/adamic/index.html">A social network caught in the Web</a> with thanks to S&eacute;bastien Paquet for <a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0110772/2003/07/23.html#a985">pointing to it</a> .  What a great pair of articles to have read in the same day.</p>

<p>I have an an ongoing conversation with several of my very best friends about group vs. individual dynamics.  Clay&#39;s piece will add a few beautiful facets to consider.  Really great stuff.</p>
