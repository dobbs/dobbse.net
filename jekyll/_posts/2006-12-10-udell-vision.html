<p>I want <a href="http://weblog.infoworld.com/udell/2006/12/08.html#a1574">Jon Udell&#39;s new job</a> -- well not exactly, but something like it.  How can I make more of my time available for my philanthropic ambitions?</p>

<p>The vision Jon is hoping to clarify in the next month is a perfect example of how I think it&#39;s supposed to work.  Pick some things you want to do for the world and find someone who will pay you to do them.  I suspect there&#39;s a prerequisite of having demonstrated a level of integrity and competence in order to get someone to finance it.  But that&#39;s what I&#39;m looking for in my own life.</p>

<p>The interests Jon outlines are very close to my heart: how technology can support education, transparency in government, and clever business-based environmental initiatives.  Although it wasn&#39;t on his immediate list, I know from following his work over the years that he&#39;s also interested in identity and information responsibility, which has my most recent interest.</p>

<p>Jon, while you&#39;re aiming to bring some of this excellent geeky tech to non-alpha-geeks, I&#39;d like to add <a href="http://dobbse.net/thinair/2006/12/information-responsibility.html">information responsibility</a>.  I think it&#39;s already there, but I&#39;m just hoping to get it included explicitly.  My recent experience with <a href="http://dobbse.net/thinair/2006/10/fingerprints.html">our local school system choosing biometrics to solve long lunch lines</a> has made me acutely aware that there&#39;s knowledge in the heads of alpha-geeks that&#39;s just not widely understood.  I think this intersects with your interests in identity, security, transparency in government, and your recent bits about translucent databases.  And it&#39;s also gotta be interesting that this presents itself in a public school.</p>
