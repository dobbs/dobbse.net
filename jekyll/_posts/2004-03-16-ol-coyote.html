<p>My former boss, <a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0101170/">Coyote Gulch</a> was caught on film [1] at the 2004 Emerging Tech conference.</p>

<p><a href="http://x180.net/Articles/Conferences/EmergingTech04/index.html">James posted a picture of the lobby bar</a> and the Ol&#39; Coyote is seated with his powerbook in the lower right corner of the picture.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a moment right out of <a href="http://allconsuming.net/item.cgi?isbn=0738206083">Smart Mobs</a> -- one unsuspecting blogger is captured by the digital camera of another blogger who publishes the evidence.  A third blogger connects the dots.  Fun.</p>

<p>[1] &quot;caught on film&quot; -- odds are good the camera was digital and not film, but somehow &quot;caught on <span class="caps">CCD</span>&quot; doesn&#39;t quite ... um ... capture the image.  :-)</p>

<p>Eric!  You've outed me to the world.  Everyone will now know that Coyote.Gulch == COVERT  Just my luck, someone you read would reinforce Mrs. Gulch's contention that I'm obsessive about being connected.  Sheesh, I can't even check my work e-mail when I'm out of town. :-)</p>

<p>Sorry bout that.  Didn't know you were incognito.  :-)<br />
I'll make some edits to minimize the damage.</p>

<p>I don't know if I like the looks of DELETED.  It puts me in mind of some science fiction future where someone (in a stiff uniform and jack boots) has a finger on a delete key, or even worse, some artificial intelligence get's to decide. :-)</p>

<p>Yeah, that does have a nasty ring to it.  How 'bout 'ANONYMOUS'?  I think it kinda drives home the point.</p>
