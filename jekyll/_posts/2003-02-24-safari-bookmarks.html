<p><cite>Charles Miller<cite> <a href="http://fishbowl.pastiche.org/archives/001257.html">asked</a> <q>Is there an AppleScripty way to manipulate Safari bookmarks? I'd like to be able to mirror my NetNewsWire subscriptions there.</q></p>

<p>Safari's AppleScript dictionary doesn't expose anything bookmark related.  Maybe it will in a later beta release.  In the meantime the bookmarks are stored as XML in ~/Library/Safari/Bookmarks.plist.  I edited that file directly with the Property List Editor and successfully added bookmarks, though the editing would have been quicker in emacs.  I basically copied other entries modifying values as appropriate.  I made up the WebBookmarkUUID element (you'll have to look at the file to see what I'm talking about).  I have no idea if the one I concocted will conflict with Safari's ID generation.  Also, I had to quit and re-launch Safari for the bookmark to show up in the UI.</p>

<p>Can anyone tell me if this bookmarks XML file has been the same format since Safari came out?  If I write an app that goes and edits this file, will it break in earlier versions of Safari?</p>
