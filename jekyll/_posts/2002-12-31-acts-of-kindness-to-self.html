<p>Here are some resolutions I accomplished this year.  I can't remember if they were New Year's Resolutions or just little "r" resolutions, but they are accomplishments.<br />
    <ul><br />
      <li>Married Sarah.</li><br />
      <li>Skied enough to make season pass a very good bargain.</li><br />
      <li>Nailed all three release dates at work.</li><br />
      <li>Learned, advocated, and taught several XP's practices.  Planning Game, Short Releases, Metaphor, Simple Design, Collective Ownership, Continuous Integration, and Coding Standards all helped us meet the deadlines.  It's also a measure of my success in leading the team to experiment with those practices.  Our QA Manager and I were consistently Testing, I was unit testing, he was acceptance testing.  I tried Refactoring.  But I couldn't persuade the rest of the team to adopt those practices nor Pair Programming.  We practiced a 45-hour or 50-hour Week.  We continually suffered from too little communication with our over-stretched Product Manager, the closest we could get to an On-site Customer.</li><br />
      <li>Rode the bus to work most weeks.  That was my little contribution to several causes: reducing Denver's Brown Cloud, reducing the US reliance on petroleum, reducing my own consumption.</li><br />
      <li>Decided to sell my car to contribute more.</li><br />
      <li>Actually sold it. :-)</li><br />
      <li>Made a habit of buying mostly organic food.</li><br />
      <li>Stopped eating most meals at restaurants.</li><br />
      <li>Shopped at the farmer's market.</li><br />
      <li>Spent more of my money at locally owned businesses.</li><br />
      <li>Reused more, recycled more, and threw away less.  Bought products in larger volumes or in bulk to reduce the amount of packaging I bought in the first place.</li><br />
    </ul></p>
