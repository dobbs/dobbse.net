<p>My earliest computer memory is from second or third grade (1975-76).  A guy brought a line printer with a modem coupling into our schoool.  The program in question allowed you to enter a number up to fourteen digits (or something like that) and it would type out the written form of that number.  I think half the class asked for 99,999,999,999,999.  No, I don't remember what the written form is.  It was a cool demo for as young as we were.</p>

<p>But my first memory of actually playing with a computer is of Adventure.</p>
<p>When I was about nine, I think, Dad took my brother, Greg, and I to his office.  To keep us out of everyone's hair he handed us off to "the computer guy."  Computer Guy sat us down at a terminal built into the side of a computer which spanned the length of the wall.  I think I remember it having Digital's name on it and being mostly blue.  It might have been a PDP-10 or -11, but I was too young to know one way or another, and the memories are old enough now that I can't even be sure about the color.  Computer Guy started up Adventure and showed us a few basic commands to navigate and then left us alone to explore.  At some point he came back and showed us the magic words xyzzy and plugh.  Greg and I were completely hooked.</p>

<p>When I was twelve I got my first computer, an Atari 800.  I chose it over an Apple II because I liked it's editing mode better and I thought I was going to program games.  It was on my Atari that I first played Zork I.  I think I played it for a month before I remembered playing Adventure at Dad's work.  I became an Infocom junkie.  I bought Zork II and III and Hitch Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy with my allowance.  I bought InvisiClues.</p>

<p>In high school I got rid of my Atari and bought an Apple IIc.  The computers at school were Apple's and I'd long since given up on programming video games.  I wrote several different character generators for DnD in BASIC.  Later on I tried to write one in Pascal, but the data structure I created to hold the characters was too big to compile.  Some years later I sold my Apple IIc, the Okidata printer my Dad got me as a birthday present, and all my software to help pay for one semester of college.</p>

<p>In my first job after college, a coworker asked me why I always used the metasyntactic variables plugh and xyzzy.  I recounted the tale of Dad's work and Computer Guy and Zork.  After that conversation I got on the net and found a port of Infocom games to MacOS.  I was so excited to get back in the little white house with the trophy case.</p>

<p>Five or more years later, I recounted the tale to another coworker.  After hearing me reminisce about it for a while he said, "you'll like this, then" and promptly beamed me a copy of <a href="http://member.newsguy.com/~hangard/frobnitz/">Frobnitz</a> for my Palm III!</p>
