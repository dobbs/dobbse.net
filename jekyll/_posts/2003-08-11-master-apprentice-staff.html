<p>Master: What is this I hold before you in my hand?</p>

<p>Apprentice: It is a staff, Master.</p>

<p>Master: Correct.  But wrong.  (whap) <em>hits the apprentice on the arm</em></p>

<p>Apprentice: Ouch!</p>

<p>Master: What is this I hold before you in my hand?</p>

<p>Apprentice: It is four feet long and made of wood, Master.</p>

<p>Master: Correct.  But wrong.  (whap) <em>hits the apprentice on the thigh</em></p>

<p>Apprentice: Ouch!</p>

<p>Master: What is this I hold before you in my hand?</p>

<p>Apprentice: It is a walking stick, carved from the limb of an ancient tree and given to you by your Master.</p>

<p>Master: Correct.  But wrong.  (whap) <em>hits the apprentice on the arm</em></p>

<p>Apprentice: Ouch!</p>

<p>Master: What is this I hold before you in my hand?</p>

<p>Apprentice: It is a collection of molecules, atomic particles, and sub-atomic particles bound together by various energies and wielded as used to aid walking or as a weapon.</p>

<p>Master: Correct.  But wrong.  (whap) <em>sweeps the legs out from under the Apprentice</em> (thud)</p>

<p>Apprentice: Ouch! <em>gets back on his feet</em></p>

<p>Master: What is this I hold before you in my hand?</p>

<p>Apprentice: It is an extension of your body, Master.</p>

<p>Master: Correct.  But wrong.  (whoosh)</p>

<p>Apprentice: <em>ducks the master&#39;s shot to the head</em></p>

<p>Master: Excellent!  What is this I hold before you in my hand?</p>

<p>Apprentice: Painful, Master.</p>

<p>Master: Correct.  But wrong.  (whoosh)</p>

<p>Apprentice: <em>jumps over a sweeping attack at the legs</em></p>

<p>Master: Excellent!  What is this I hold before you in my hand?</p>

<p>Apprentice: I do not know, Master.</p>

<p>Master: Then you must study it more closely.  <em>hands it to the Apprentice and exits</em></p>

<p>No description or label can capture the wholeness of the instrument held in the master&#39;s hand.  Words are a flashlight in a dark cavern.  They illuminate one small spot and cast the rest into shadow.</p>

<p><em>You are in dark.  You are likely to be eaten by a grue.</em></p>
