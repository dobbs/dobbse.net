<p>Just noticed that I haven&#39;t seen a chain letter in months.  No <a href="http://www.npr.org/about/urbanmyth.html">NPR funding myth</a>, no <a href="http://hoaxbusters.ciac.org/HBMalCode.shtml">bogus virus warnings</a>, no warnings to send this to five friends or <a href="http://www.umsl.edu/~rbanis/hoaxes.htm">Bad Things will happen</a>.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure I&#39;m happy with the change.  But I think the spam meme has drown the chain letter meme, at least for my inbox.</p>

<p>Please note:  this is <strong>not</strong> an invitation to send me chain letters!</p>
