<p><a href="http://dobbse.net/thinair/2008/12/alan-kay.html">Alan Kay and computational thinking</a> part 2.</p>

<p>In most demos, Alan Kay shows off a sequence of tutorials from <a href="http://squeakland.org">Etoys</a>.  These are lessons in powerful ideas specifically designed for children, but I think they&#39;re equally powerful for adults too.</p>

<h3>Drive a Car</h3>

<p>If you want to play along, <a href="http://squeakland.org/download/">download a copy of etoys</a>.</p>

<p>In this lesson children <a href="http://squeakland.org/launcher/?http://squeakland.org/content/articles/attach/JustPaintedCar.012.pr">use a built-in paint program in Etoys to paint their own car</a>.  In the next tutorial, they <a href="http://squeakland.org/launcher/?http://squeakland.org/content/articles/attach/CarAndPen.013.pr">write instructions to make the car drive around the screen in various ways</a>.  These become lessons in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turtle_graphics">turtle graphics</a> from logo.  To an uninformed adult, it just looks like a funny way to draw geometric shapes.  But closer examination of turtle graphics reveals something profound.  They are a beautiful existence proof that powerful software tools enable elementary aged children to learn very high level mathematics, in this case, differential geometry of vectors.  As with the <a href="http://dobbse.net/thinair/2008/12/growth-and-polygons.html">example of geometric growth</a>, there are also experiential lessons in functions and infinity.  Students can learn how different combinations of very simple concepts (e.g. repeat, move forward a little, turn a little) can lead to larger forms.  Moreover, they get direct and concrete experience with variables (a key ingredient of algebra), a powerful idea that can otherwise seem quite abstract and confusing.</p>

<p>In <a href="http://squeakland.org/launcher/?http://squeakland.org/content/articles/attach/SpeedAcceleration.010.pr">an exercise on Speed and Acceleration</a>, students compare constant velocity, constant acceleration, and random acceleration in a fairly direct way.</p>

<p>There&#39;s another fun lesson in these activities that I haven&#39;t heard Alan Kay mention directly.  When these lessons call for the car to leave a trail of dots behind, students are subtly introduced to the fundamental concept of graphing and visualizing mathematical behavior.  Although the exercises in these examples don&#39;t go there, turtle graphics can reinforce lessons about the number line and introduce Cartesian coordinates.</p>
