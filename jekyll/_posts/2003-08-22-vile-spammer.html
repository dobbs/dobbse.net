<p>Not only have you imposed your marketing scam on an enormous list of uninterested recipients, you&#39;ve presented yourself as <span class="caps">ME,</span> you slimey, wicked, cowardly impostor!  You are twice despicable for each vulgar message you send: once for your selfish imposition on the recipient and once for the bounced replies to me.  You may evade the direct consequences but you cannot evade the fact of your abusive, devious, shady, swindling character.  You draw to yourself the same that you deal out.  Your own villainy will gnaw you to the marrow of your bones.</p>
