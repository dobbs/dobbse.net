<p>Once you learn lisp, you almost immediately want to convert ten friends to the church of lisp.  But there&#39;s a fundamental problem.  You&#39;ve learned things about programming that your friends haven&#39;t.  You will use vocabulary and metaphors and examples which will have <em>absolutely no meaning whatsoever</em> to your intended converts.  This is hugely frustrating and leads most people to just give up the evangelism (or at least back off a little ;-).  You either wallow in the frustration or re-adjust your expectations for a longer-term conversion.  Your friends aren&#39;t going to get it until they walk down the path to lisp on their own.</p>

<p>defmacro has made a valiant attempt to explain lisp using things you already know.  If you&#39;re not already a fan of lisp, go read <a href="http://www.defmacro.org/ramblings/lisp.html">The Nature of Lisp</a>.  Hopefully you&#39;ll see the light.  :-)</p>

<p>Thanks to James Duncan Davidson for pointing to this great link.</p>

<p>Commenting on the content itself, it was a thing of inspiration to use <span class="caps">XML</span> and Ant in particular for this bootstrapping.  But I can&#39;t resist the need to rehash my most recent complaint about Java.  It&#39;s a code smell that Duncan had to invent another language in order to build tomcat.  Java isn&#39;t flexible enough on its own to let you <strong>build</strong> your java apps.  Sure the parser is in Java, but the build language is still Ant or Maven.</p>
