<p>Comments have been broken for months.  Please email your comments to <a href="mailto:blog-comment@dobbse.net">blog-comment@dobbse.net</a>.  Be sure to include the url of the post on which you&#39;re commenting.  I enjoy when people politely disagree with me, or when they add something I didn&#39;t know.  I also appreciate being corrected.  What I don&#39;t appreciate is anything spam-like -- advertise on your own blog, not mine.</p>

<p>Why are my comments broken?  A bit before Elliott was born someone launched what looked like a denial-of-service attack on my site via the Movable Type comments exploit.  The comments all had links to nonexistent domains -- apparently random strings of characters.  I changed the permissions on the comments cgi file and haven&#39;t had enough time to repair the damage.</p>

<p>I started to re-implement my comment moderation system so that the comments don&#39;t even get into Movable Type&#39;s database until I approve them.  I have grown tired of deleting comment spam but it hasn&#39;t really been high enough volume to justify the extra software development until this <span class="caps">DOS</span> attack.  Unfortunately for my blog, spending time with Elliott and Sarah is a lot more fun than hacking my new comment moderation system.</p>

<p>Someday I&#39;ll get the comments working again and maybe post something about the implementation.</p>
