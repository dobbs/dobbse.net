<p>Dear Elliott,</p>

<p>I think you&#39;re too young right now to understand.  I&#39;m writing it here where you can hopefully read it when you&#39;re older -- maybe after you have kids of your own -- and where I can remember it later.</p>

<p>I was stressed about time this morning while getting ready for work.  Mama and I are overwhelmed making room for your sister.  I&#39;ve been working more hours anticipating the sleep deprivation that comes with a newborn.  I&#39;m also investing a lot of time in Columbine&#39;s rebirth.  I try to remind myself time is not a limitation, only a tool for organizing, but that wisdom is an extremely difficult practice.</p>

<p>While I was reminding myself to breathe and hastily folding yet another load of laundry, you suggested to Mama that we all go for a walk.  You had to suggest it several times before Mama and I snapped out of our routines.  Mama ran her first errand alone while you walked me to work.  Thank you so much for suggesting it.</p>

<p>All urgencies evaporated.  As you said &quot;boys sometimes walk, and sometimes pick up trashcans,&quot; I followed your cue and righted a neighbor&#39;s trashcan that had blown over in yesterday&#39;s wind.  You talked about &quot;being careful of the pokey branches&quot; as you stepped carefully around a bush overgrowing the sidewalk, protecting your &quot;baby sister&quot; -- today&#39;s name for your neon blue and green monkey.</p>

<p>Thank you for the way you kept holding my hand even after we&#39;d crossed an intersection.  Thanks for the few minutes we took to watch the mighty front loader moving a pile of rocks for the flood mitigation happening at Elmer Two-Mile Park.  Mostly, thank you for drawing my attention back to The Here and Now and helping me let go of The Urgent.</p>

<p>Love, Daddy</p>
