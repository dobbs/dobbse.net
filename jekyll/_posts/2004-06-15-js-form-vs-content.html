<p>I&#39;m stewing on an JavaScript idea.  I&#39;m short on tinkering time, so I haven&#39;t built an example.  Maybe it&#39;s a job for the lazy web. ;-)</p>

<p>How about stripping all of the navigation clutter out of a web page and using JavaScript to insert it for web browsers.  Instead of just <a href="http://www.fiftyfoureleven.com/sandbox/pullquote/">extracting a pullquote</a> or <a href="http://simon.incutio.com/archive/2004/05/30/plinks">adding paragraph anchors</a>, add all but the most essential navigation via JavaScript.  It would be a more extreme separation of form from content.  Give the Googlebot and its colleagues only the relevant content in the page and none of the tangential navigation.</p>

<p>I&#39;d also want to make use of <link...> tags to store the &quot;related items&quot; or &quot;see also&quot; kinds of info.  Some navigation links don&#39;t belong inline with the post itself but are sufficiently related to the content that they would do well to be included in the page -- the stuff that would help the search engines connect the dots.</p>

<p>The JavaScript code could extract data from the link tags to produce content-related navigation in addition to the common header and sidebar.</p>

<p>A number of things have inspired this idea.  <a href="http://www.sitepoint.com/blog-post-view.php?id=171578">Simon has been pushing out some interesting JavaScript goodies</a> lately, and I have my own <a href="https://dobbse.net/reflection/2003/12/000157.html">experiments with a JavaScript animation language in SVG</a>.  But the clincher for me was a masterful piece of JavaScript that I bloghopped to a few weeks back amid the <a href="http://www.jluster.org/node/view/103">purple-link, plink buzz</a>.  Unfortunately I failed to bookmark it or blog it or copy and paste it.  Surprisingly I cannot find my way back to it via Google, nor by retracing my footsteps through comments in various blogs.</p>

<p>I&#39;m left describing it in words.  <em>Seems to be a theme today: words without examples</em>.  Sigh.</p>

<p>It was a page of latinesque gibberish, if I remember correctly, with light grey pilcrow marks at the end of each paragraph.  Nothing notable at first glance.  But then a small <span class="caps">UFO</span> enters the page and bee-lines it to a position just above the first pilcrow on the page.  There&#39;s a small shadow of the <span class="caps">UFO</span> which creates the sense of depth.  Once in position, a beam extends from the <span class="caps">UFO</span> to the ground and the pilcrow mark floats up within the beam into the <span class="caps">UFO.  </span>Then the <span class="caps">UFO</span> bee-lines it to it&#39;s next abduction victim.</p>

<p>I glanced briefly over the source and it was all done in JavaScript.  A really fun piece of work.  How I wish I&#39;d bookmarked it.  How I wish I could find my way back to it.  If you saw it too and know how to get back to it, please speak up in the comments below.</p>

<p><ins>Update:</ins>  Hoorah!  Simon provided the link in the comments.  Thanks, Simon. <a href="http://www.mooncalf.me.uk/scripts/plinks/">the plink abductor</a></p>

<p>The search itself exposed one of the other sources of inspiration.  I&#39;m tired of landing on sights because they happen to mention one of my search terms in their side bar but nothing in their content is related to my search.  There&#39;s just enough in the Google snippet to lure me to click, but only disappointment to be found when I get there.</p>

<p>There&#39;s a fun way that the search engines and web practices are growing symbiotically.  Replacing tables and dot.gif image tags with <span class="caps">CSS</span> leads to more clean and perhaps even meaningful markup without loosing beautiful designs.  Is this idea a useful extension of that idea?  Maybe I&#39;ll have to actually tinker with it before I can get a good answer to that question.</p>
