<p>Few quick notes.</p>

<p>Apparently there&#39;s a cable splitter somewhere in the building which has gone bad.  My access to the &#39;Net care of Comcast dropped out on Saturday.  On Monday the technician couldn&#39;t find the splitter.  Since I&#39;m moving this weekend I just left it at that and have stepped down to dial-up.  Broadband in the new place will take about 10 days to sort itself out too.  Sigh.</p>

<p>I&#39;m most of the way through opening the comments on my older posts.  This is a pretty tedious process and I probably won&#39;t get to the oldest ones until after the move.</p>
