<p>Did <a href="https://dobbse.net/thinair/2003/08/000131.html">You vile spammers</a> create Sobig specifically to enable more spam?  If so <a href="http://asia.cnet.com/newstech/security/0,39001150,39148186,00.htm">the FBI is onto your horrendous, criminal scheme</a></p>

<blockquote><p>The Sobig viruses--the first of which was created in January--are thought to be created as a moneymaker. The viruses turn every infected <span class="caps">PC</span> into an &quot;open proxy,&quot; or a system that can be used to send spam. Security experts believe that the programmers of Sobig sell the list of open proxies to underground bulk e-mailers that need to send anonymous e-mail.</p></blockquote>
