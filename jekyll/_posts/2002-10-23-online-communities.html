<p>Thanks to <a href="http://www.cwinters.com/">Chris Winters</a> for <a href="http://www.cwinters.com/News/show/?news_id=253">pointing out</a> chromatic's article <a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/a/network/2002/10/21/community.html">Building  Online Communities</a>.  I'm interested in online communities and communities in general.  <a href="/reflection/2002/09/000057.html#education">One of my unstarted projects</a> is an online community.  And recently there's been some heated discussion among Apache committers about that communitiy.  That's a discussion from which I am learning a ton, but the volume of messages is like drinking from a firehose.  There's also some interesting documents <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/site/">at Jakarta</a> covering various aspects of online community.  And the blogsphere is teaching me a lot as well.</p>
