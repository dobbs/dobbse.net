<p>Greg Wilson&#39;s presentation at SciPy 2006 was one of the most sane things I have heard regarding what really should be the basics for an introductory programming course.  His target audience are scientists who must do a lot of programming these days.  But I thought his problem description exactly matched what I see in professional software development.  I suspect if you have any interest in educating programmers, you should look at <a href="http://www.swc.scipy.org/">Software Carpentry</a> and get in touch with Greg Wilson.</p>
