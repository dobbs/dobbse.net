<p>Just noticing some links between Jon's post today <a "http://weblog.infoworld.com/udell/2002/10/22.html#a477">&#65279;Mac OS X culture mapping: stirring the melting pot</a> and my earlier post about <a href="https://dobbse.net/thinair/2002/09/000018.html">changes in Apple's market</a>.  In that post I concluded by saying <em>It'll be interesting to see how Apple adapts to a changing user base</em>.  In light of Jon's post, it'll be much more interesting to see how the various cultures collide and blend.</p>

<p>One other fun side effect of OS X.  OS choices have narrowed somewhat thanks to NeXT's stealth takeover of Apple.  (Three cheers for NeXT!)  You can choose some flavor of Unix, or something from Microsoft.  As a long time Mac bigot, it's fun to see Windows in the position of being the odd ball OSes.</p>
