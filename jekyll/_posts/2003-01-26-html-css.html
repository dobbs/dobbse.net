<p>I learned some new HTML and CSS tricks yesterday while studying <a href="http://diveintomark.org/">Mark Pilgrim's site</a>.  In addition to offering a really good example to study, he also pointed to <a href="http://ln.hixie.ch/?start=1037595583&count=1">Hixie's markup challenge</a>.  I bloghopped around some related sites from there.  It only makes me more alarmed about the markup in <a href="http://dobbse.net/resume/">my resume</a> which has worried me for a while now.  I've felt too busy with other job hunting tasks.  My resume is in XML and I'm using <a href="http://ant.apache.org/">Ant</a> and <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/velocity/dvsl/">DVSL</a> to transform it into HTML.  I'm halfway through the process of moving that to a more current version of <a href="http://xmlresume.sourceforge.net/">XML resume</a> which uses XSL for the transformation.  Anyway, someday soon I'll fix my resume to have good symantic markup and CSS for the presentation.</p>
