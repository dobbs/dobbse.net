<p>I've been doing some math while <a href="/thinair/2002/11/000071.html">Sarah has been writing</a>, and hacking a little <a href="http://www.objectmentor.com/writeUps/TestDrivenDevelopment">test driven</a> python code when she's at her internship.  I was inspired by Chris Winters' recent post, <a href="http://www.cwinters.com/News/show/?news_id=279">Getting good</a>, and decided to just start somewhere on <a href="http://dobbse.net/reflection/2002/09/000057.html#svg-animations">SVG animations</a>.  I also plan to play with <a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0112098/2002/10/30.html#a217">Being architecture neutral</a>.</p>

<p>I spent a couple days trying to remember and re-learn some linear algebra and matrices.  It's been a long time since I've done anything more complicated mathematically than balance my checkbook.  The geometry of perspective comes naturally to me.  I'm stunned by how much more work I had to expend in order to calculate the point of intersection between two lines algebraically.  Google pointed me to <a href="http://astronomy.swin.edu.au/~pbourke/geometry/lineline2d/">a solution</a>, but I wanted to make sure I understood the math myself.</p>

<p>When I did this before, I used the (inters ...) function in AutoLISP.  Therefore, my previous code was not much use.  It will start to come in handy as I get further along.  Now that I've got a function to calculate the intersection between two lines I can get on with the more interesting parts of the problem.</p>
