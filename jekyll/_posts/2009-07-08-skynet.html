<p>This dialog from <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0103064/">Terminator 2</a> still sends chills down my spine.</p>

<p><span class="caps">SARAH</span>: I need to know how Skynet get built.  Who&#39;s responsible?</p>

<p><span class="caps">TERMINATOR</span>: The man most directly responsible is Miles Bennet Dyson, Director of Special Projects at Cyberdyne Systems Corporation.</p>

<p><span class="caps">SARAH</span>: Why him?</p>

<p><span class="caps">TERMINATOR</span>: In a few months he creates a revolutionary type of mircoprocessor.</p>

<p><span class="caps">SARAH</span>: Then what?</p>

<p><span class="caps">TERMINATOR</span>: In three years Cyberdyne will become the largest supplier of military computer systems.  All stealth bombers are upgraded with Cyberdyne computers, becoming fully unmanned,  Afterward, they fly with a perfect operational record.</p>

<p><span class="caps">SARAH</span>: Uh huh, great.  Then those fat fucks in Washington figure, what the hell, let a computer run the whole show, right?</p>

<p><span class="caps">TERMINATOR</span>: Basically. The Skynet funding bill is passed.  The system goes on-line August 4th, 1997.  Human decisions are removed from strategic defense.  Skynet begins to learn, at a geometric rate.  It becomes self-aware at 2:14 a.m. eastern time, August 29. In a panic, they try to pull the plug.</p>

<p><span class="caps">SARAH</span>: And Skynet fights back.</p>

<p><span class="caps">TERMINATOR</span>: Yes.  It launches its <span class="caps">ICB</span>Ms against their targets in Russia.</p>

<p><span class="caps">SARAH</span>: Why attack Russia?</p>

<p><span class="caps">TERMINATOR</span>: Because Skynet knows the Russian counter-strike will remove its enemies here.</p>
