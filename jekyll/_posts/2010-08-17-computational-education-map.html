<p>It seems I&#39;ve started down the road of systemic education reform which for me is focused on effective use of technology for learning and teaching.  This is a rough map of what I&#39;ll be working on for the rest of my life.  Ideas range from design of instructional units and lesson plans, a whole branch of lessons from Alan Kay presentations, professional development for teachers, a collection of really big ideas that computation and networking enable, among other things.  If I have seemed like I&#39;m all over the map when speaking to you about educational technology, the &quot;systemic&quot; part might explain the appearance of a lack of focus.  No one of these things is going to bring the technology revolution to education.</p>
