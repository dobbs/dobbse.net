<p>I&#39;m kinda surprised that I haven&#39;t already seen this in my <span class="caps">RSS</span> feeds.  I&#39;m just coming back from giving a <a href="http://dobbse.net/thinair/2006/08/scipy/">presentation</a> at <a href="http://www.scipy.org/SciPy2006">SciPy2006</a> .  During the discussion following Greg Wilson&#39;s presentation about <a href="http://www.swc.scipy.org/">Software Carpentry</a>, Guido made a stronger pronouncement for <a href="http://www.djangoproject.com/">django</a>.  <a href="http://pyre.third-bit.com/blog/archives/613.html">Greg Wilson broke the news</a> immediately but apparently his social network and mine don&#39;t overlap much.  So here&#39;s another nudge to spread the meme.  Guido picked django but would like to see some convergence between django and turbogears.  As Greg put it in his post, django will be <q>as &#8220;standard&#8221; as <span class="caps">PIL</span> or NumPy</q> -- not distributed with python, but blessed as the right place to start.</p>
