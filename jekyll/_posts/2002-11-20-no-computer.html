<p>My wife is in the very last weeks of her masters thesis.  Because we can't get her computer to work with my printer, she's been using mine.  It's been illuminating to see just how much of my life requires a computer.  It's not that I couldn't live if the Net imploded tomorrow.  But there's no question that it would be a radical change in lifestyle.</p>
