<p>This behavior is described in <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/expose/">Apple&#39;s pitch about Expos&eacute;</a> but I didn&#39;t catch it until after I&#39;d seen it in action.  I think it deserves a little more attention.</p>

<p>At some point, when you have a bunch of windows open in a bunch of applications, hit <span class="caps">F9</span> to activate expos&eacute;.  Then use Alt-tab.  Expos&eacute; remains active but the windows displayed narrow to only those for the application you&#39;ve just tabbed to.  Now tab to a different application and watch that app&#39;s windows take center stage.  Nice touch, Apple!</p>

<p>Looks like I may no longer need the screen grooming habits that I&#39;ve developed over the years.  :)</p>
