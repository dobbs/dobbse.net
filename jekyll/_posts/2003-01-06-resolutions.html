<p>This will be a fun experiment.  By blogging my resolutions now, next year I will be able to look back and see how I did.</p>

<p><span class="title">More quick blog entries</span>, less worrying about whether my blog is Important and Interesting.  I've been missing the point of blogging.  Too much focus on what I think Someone Else will think is interesting.  Instead I want to focus on what interests me and let Someone Else decide for herself if she agrees.</p>

<p><span class="title">Miscellaneous blog chores.</span>  Upgrade Movable Type, publish my blogroll<del>, make RSS feeds validate, make a full-content RSS feed for aggregators</del>.  Some template and CSS improvements.  'Nuff said.</p>

<p><ins>Update: <a href="https://dobbse.net/thinair/2003/02/000086.html">RSS feeds validate</a> and <a href="https://dobbse.net/thinair/2003/02/000089.html">also include full contents.</a></ins></p>

<p><span class="title">Be kinder to myself.</span>  In several conversations with Sarah over the holidays, it has become clear that I have totally unrealistic expectations of myself.  I like that I haven't lost my youthful enthusiasm and the belief that I can change the world, but self-doubt (also known as fear) has twisted that belief into an <em>expectation</em>.  There's no evidence I can provide The Angry Management that I am "meeting or exceeding expectations."  Self-doubt twists into self-abuse for failure to change the world.  That particular twist is incredibly self-destructive and incredibly arrogant.  Sarah said something like this: "Honey, I love you.  But you need to get over yourself."  It was much more compassionate than it reads.  To be kinder to myself, I will release the arrogant expectations and judgmental self-abuse and re-emphasize the <em>belief</em> in self.</p>

<p><span class="title">Spend more time with people.</span>  Dance regularly.  Go to the dojo more consistently.  Attend the local user groups: COMUG, XP-Denver, BJUG.  Ski with friends.  Participate in some of the Boulder Food Co-op community activities.</p>

<p><span class="title">Take a more active role in my communities.</span> Do a presentation for one of the user groups.  More work on Turbine.  Help with Aikido Summer Camp in the Rockies.  I subscribed to community@apache.org on Saturday.  More quick blog entries.</p>

<p><span class="title">I also got a head start on some of this year's resolutions.</span>  I bought another ski pass and have had more early season skiing than in any previous ski season I can remember.  Sarah and I joined the food coop yesterday.  I've been going to the user groups for several months.</p>

<p>Time will tell how well I adhere to these resolutions.  :-)</p>
