<p>My brother has been enjoying <a href="http://launch.yahoo.com/">LAUNCHcast</a> since before Yahoo! bought them.  He reminded me about it today.  After <span class="caps">DSL</span> came up I went to check it out.  How truly annoying!</p>

<p>Hello Support at <span class="caps">LAUNC</span>Hcast.</p>

<p>This service is pretty unfriendly to Mac <span class="caps">OS X</span> users.  The form for customizing a radio station cannot be submitted with either Safari 1.0 (v85) or Mozilla Firebird 0.6.  The links to existing stations claim to be &quot;Launching your radio player&quot; and never do anything.  In Internet Explorer 5.2 the custom form can be submitted.  Only with <span class="caps">IE</span> and only after completing the form do I see a message that <span class="caps">OS X</span> is not supported.</p>

<p>I filled out <a href="http://launch.yahoo.com/launchcast/setup.asp">the dang form</a> three times only to learn that I have to pay the Microsoft tax to enjoy your service.  It&#39;s a long form.  At the very least your site should notify <span class="caps">OS X</span> users <em>before they complete the form</em> that you don&#39;t support the platform.  You could also make it self-evident that your service depends on Window Media Player.  The link to the <a href="http://help.yahoo.com/help/us/launch/cast/cast-01.html">LAUNCHcast system requirements</a> it too deeply nested.</p>

<p>Thanks for wasting my time.</p>

<p>ps.  <a href="http://add.yahoo.com/fast/help/us/launch/cgi_feedback">Your feedback form</a> requires that I tell you which Windows Media Player I&#39;m using.  Since I&#39;m not actually using Window Media Player, please disregard that part of my reply.</p>

<p>I also HATE the way Yahoo never pays attention to the tens of thousands of Mac users out there. Below is the email I sent their customer care department, and I urge anyone viewing this page to send them a letter too.</p>

<p>"Dear Yahoo!<br />
I've been a Yahoo! user for quite a while, I've been a <br />
Mac user for longer. </p>

<p>First of all, I just love the way you allow Windows users to pick their specific Operating System, but of course Macintosh users are a general, unimportant category for you. Did it ever occur to you that some people use Mac OS 9 and some use OS X and they're two COMPLETELY DIFFERENT operating systems.</p>

<p>Anyway, here's my story/complaint:<br />
After joining Yahoo!, I began <br />
to realize that in most portions of your site, you <br />
don't support Mac OS X, or in some cases, you don't <br />
support Macs at all.<br />
I use Safari 1.2.2, a wonderful product by Apple. In <br />
my opinion it is the best web browser available and <br />
I hate using Internet Explorer or Netscape. <br />
Nevertheless, every time I try to upload a file to my <br />
Yahoo! Photos account, or do the same in Yahoo! <br />
Briefcase, your server lets me know that there was <br />
some error in the transfer. I start up Internet <br />
Explorer and everything works fine. This is fine and <br />
it works for me now, but it would be much easier if <br />
I could do everything from Safari.<br />
Also, Yahoo! Launch is a big problem for me. I have <br />
used Launch on Windows computers and think its a <br />
great idea and service, however, IT DOESN'T WORK <br />
ON MAC OS X! I even tried following your <br />
requirements (something like Mac OS 9, Netscape <br />
4.0+, Windows Media Player 7+ Flash Plugin) I <br />
started up Classic environment, downloaded and <br />
installed the old versions of all the appropriate <br />
programs and plugins (this took at least an hour) <br />
and, with great anticipation and excitement, started <br />
up my Launch station.<br />
However, my Launch station was still not accessible <br />
to me, it wouldn't work.<br />
I then realized that Launch probably doesn't work in <br />
the Classic environment. If you don't go to the <br />
trouble of adapting you service to work on normal <br />
Mac computers, you probably wouldn't go to the <br />
trouble of adding support for the OS X Classic <br />
Environment.<br />
I restarted my computer into Mac OS 9 and thought <br />
I had finally figured it out. I started up Netscape, <br />
visited Launch.com and started my player.<br />
And it seemed like it was working for the first <br />
couple seconds, the images and Flash objects <br />
loaded and it told me it was "Tuning". It never <br />
stopped tuning.<br />
So after finding out that after hours of work and a <br />
huge amount of effort, I had produced a "Tuning" <br />
screen.<br />
My hopes were rekindled when the new version of <br />
Launchcast radio arrived. I thought you had finally <br />
added support for Macs. You hadn't. I returned to <br />
my dissapointed state and began to search <br />
message boards across the internet for an equal <br />
alternative to your service. I never found one and <br />
decided to write you an email.<br />
It is my hope that this email, along with countless <br />
others I'm sure you will recieve from enraged Mac <br />
users, will help you to consider adding support for <br />
Macs, especially those running OS X.</p>

<p>As of now, thanks for wasting my time, I continue <br />
to enjoy uploading files to Briefcase and Photos in <br />
Internet Explorer.</p>

<p>Signed,<br />
A J<br />
(Mac OS 10.3, Safari 1.2.2, Flash Player 7, Windows <br />
Media Player 9.0 [although I hope I never have to <br />
use this not-nearly-as-good-as-quicktime-and-<br />
not-even-close-to-iTunes software again)</p>

<p>P.S. Yahoo Mail works perfectly as far as i've found <br />
and I thank you very much for that."</p>
