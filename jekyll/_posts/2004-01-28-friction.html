<p>I somewhat disagree with Jon on this point from <a href="http://www.infoworld.com/article/04/01/23/04OPstrategic_1.html">The art and science of software testing</a></p>

<blockquote><p>When up to half of the output of a full-blown <span class="caps">TDD</span>-style project can be test code, we&#39;re going to want to find ways to automate and streamline the effort.</p></blockquote>

<p>If you discipline yourself to write the test first, then any it-would-be-cool feature becomes immediately twice as expensive.  As a lazy programmer I don&#39;t want to put the effort into writing a test for some speculative flexibility until the customer actually asks for a feature requiring it.  The time-cost of writing tests creates natural resistance to unnecessary bloat.  With that in mind, I would be cautious about streamlining the testing effort.  Too much streamlining will take away this really excellent side-effect of testing first.</p>
