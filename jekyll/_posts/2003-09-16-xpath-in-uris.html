<p>I was wondering how long it would be before the dots were connected between <span class="caps">UR</span>Ls and XPaths.  I was thinking it would be a ways off yet given the <a href="http://diveintomark.org/archives/2003/01/13/semantic_obsolescence">well publicized problems with XHTML</a> .  I also expected to see the XPath after the # on the <span class="caps">URL.  </span>It seemed like the XPath should be treated as inside document.</p>

<p>Today <a href="http://weblog.infoworld.com/udell/2003/09/16.html#a797">Jon Udell pointed to Kimbro Staken&#39;s XPath-searchable blog</a></p>

<blockquote><p>I just love this idea of incorporating XPath into <span class="caps">RES</span>Tian <span class="caps">UR</span>Ls. With Kimbro&#39;s approach, you get immediate use of the markup you create -- just the kind of incentive that&#39;s needed.</p></blockquote>

<p><a href="http://www.xmldatabases.org/WK/blog/262?t=item">Kimbro&#39;s post</a> is currently not responding.  Probably slashdotted.  It could be fun to watch the blogsphere elaborate on this idea.  The immediate payback could be just the thing to drive adoption of clean-markup-and-CSS.</p>

<p><ins>Update:  Having now had a chance to browse Kimbro&#39;s post, I can&#39;t wait to see the code behind his site.  I&#39;ve also been looking at PyBlosxom as a potential replacement for Movable Type.  Python, XPath and weblog sounds like a tasty recipe to me.</ins></p>
