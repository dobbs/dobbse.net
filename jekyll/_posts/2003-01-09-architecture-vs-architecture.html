<p>At the <a href="http://www.boulderjug.org">Boulder Java User Group</a> meeting this evening <cite>Martin Fowler</cite> noted <q>the word Architecture is just a puffed-up way to talk about design.  It isn't just design, it's <em>architecture</em>.</q></p>

<p>A short note to add a to a tangent in Chris Winter's <a href="http://www.cwinters.com/News/show/?news_id=765">Perfection and organic growth</a>.<blockquote cite="http://www.cwinters.com/News/show/?news_id=765">I also have a suspicion that lots of other types of designers -- architects, urban planners, automobiles -- have these same sort of overdesign tendencies. But because their constructs are real and have a substantial cost associated with tearing them down they have to confront the unlimited possibilities demon earlier.</blockquote></p>

<p>The art of constructing buildings has been going on for more than three thousand years.  That's a lot of time to refine the art.</p>
