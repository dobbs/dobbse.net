<p>Enjoyed this post on <a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0110772/">Seb's Open Research</a>:  <a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0110772/2002/09/30.html#a374">People as neurons, reaching out</a></p>

<p>It seems there's even <a href="http://www.peterussell.com/GB/Chap8.html">a book</a> about <a href="/thinair/2002/09/000036.html">Earth's nervous system</a>.</p>
