<p>Jeremy Allaire has stirred up some buzz.  There&#39;s one point about this <span class="caps">RSS</span>-Data I don&#39;t think has been made.</p>

<p>There&#39;s all sorts of hype and excitement about other applications for <span class="caps">RSS,</span> but what we have right now is mostly vaporware.  The blogsphere certainly proves the utility of <span class="caps">RSS,</span> but other applications are at most speculative.  Introducing a low-threshold format for publish-subscribe exchanges of objects could be just the ticket to get some real application development rolling.  As real applications appear and crystalize, then schemas can be formalized for those applications.</p>

<p>If you haven&#39;t already been following the discussion here&#39;s what I&#39;ve read:</p>

<ul><li><a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0113297/2003/10/01.html#a236">RSS-Data: A Proposed Format</a> and <a href="http://radiocomments.userland.com/comments?u=113297&amp;p=236&amp;link=http%3A%2F%2Fradio.weblogs.com%2F0113297%2F2003%2F10%2F01.html%23a236">the comments</a></li>

<li><a href="http://www.decafbad.com/blog/tech/rss_data_versus_namespace.html">Les Orchard&#39;s example of an RSS 2.0 namespace versus RSS-Data usage</a> and <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/blog/tech/rss_data_versus_namespace_2.html">his first impressions</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Les&#39; examples are good for discussion.  On the surface it looks like solid argument against Jeremy&#39;s suggestion.  But despite the verbosity, I think the ability to get on with the applications is the important part.  I think Jeremy&#39;s idea will grease those wheels.</p>

<p>Eric: "As real applications appear and crystalize, then schemas can be formalized for those applications."</p>

<p>*Exactly*. RSS-Data can serve as "training wheels" for new extensions. </p>

<p>Got a new or unusual chunk of data you want to expose to the world? Wrap it up as RSS-Data and get it out there where people can immediately see it and play with it in their RSS-Data-aware aggregators. If it turns out that you're on to something, interested parties can sit down and start crafting a formal specification, and once the aggregators starting implementing the new spec, you do away with the RSS-Data wrapper and move on.</p>
