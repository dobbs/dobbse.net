<p>This would never happen with a phone book.</p>

<p>I received an email today from <a href="http://www.freemode.net/archives/00000006.html">a guy named Eric Dobbs</a>.  It was a little surreal to find email from myself in the inbox.  Apparently from Virginia, it seems we share some common interests -- unix, RPGs, hiking, and video games.</p>

<p>He was Googling for another Eric Dobbs in the Richmond area.  At the moment, I've got the first five hits at <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=eric+dobbs">http://www.google.com/search?q=eric+dobbs</a>.  The first is for thinair, second and third from back in the days when I was a MacPerl zealot, and the fourth and fifth are archived threads from turbine-dev@jakarta.apache.org.  The next few are posts on ZDNet by the Richmond Eric Dobbs.</p>

<p>I don't feel like I've been doing enough in the world to justify the first five listings on Google.  It's kinda fun, but mostly it makes me suspicious of PageRank.</p>

<p>A curious side effect of the 'Net and blogs.  I seriously doubt Eric would have called me if he'd found my name (or should I say his name) in the phone book.</p>
