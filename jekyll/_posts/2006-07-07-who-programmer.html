<p>I&#39;ve been getting a lot of email from recruiters lately.  The short answer is that I&#39;m really happy where I am.  But if you&#39;re really interested in my help, let&#39;s talk.  One of my other hats is Co-Director of Business Development and in addition to hiring me, you could also get the benefit of <a href="http://www.bivio.biz/hm/team">a really gifted team</a> to back me up on your project.  The rest of this post is an annotated collection of links to the most popular code I&#39;ve posted on this site in case you or your technical people want to <em>use the source</em> to learn more about me and how I solve problems.</p>

<p>This story includes a few short code examples in python, perl, and java.  It will also give a flavor for how I communicate in writing about technical subjects.<br />

<p>This is a longer code sample using perl to create a specialized state machine for scraping <span class="caps">HTML,</span> kind of a poor man&#39;s web services trick. ;-)  I was on a State Machine kick for a while and this was the first post with my own code.<br />

<p>Here&#39;s a story about a trend I see in the programming industry with a lot of links to other resources and a lot of java open source name dropping.<br />

<p>Here are a couple posts about perspective and vanishing points and an <span class="caps">SVG</span> animation.  You&#39;ll probably need Adobe&#39;s <span class="caps">SVG</span> plugin() to look at it.  The first illustrates some terms used in describing perspective.  The provides and animated illustration of a vanishing point.  You can look at the source for the animation (third link below) to see my experiment in using closures to create something like a specialized  animation scripting language.  Very much in the functional style of programming with just a little bit of object stuff in there too.<br />
