<p>I started my new life as an independent contractor today which is very good news.  The bad news is I don't have Mail.app's spam filter at work.  I was wading through junk mail today.  It's enough to make email completely unusable.  Time to go find a procmail solution.</p>

<p>I am going to miss the ease of the Junk button.</p>
