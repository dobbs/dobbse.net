Hey design friends:
</p>

<p>
What images do you think of when I ask you about the invisible part of design... the lines and shapes and proportions that make your design hang together in a coherent way?
</p>

<p>
I'm writing an article to teach computer geeks about design and to explain why CSS sucks as a language for designers.  I need some visual support to explain the invisible.  Words aren't going cut it.  Although beautiful images about typeface design would work nicely. :-)
</p>

<p>
I've got a few examples here: two from architecture, one a study for a figure drawing.  These are in the right direction, but I'd lovee images from many other design disciplines.
