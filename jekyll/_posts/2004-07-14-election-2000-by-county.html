<p>This just completely amazes me.  I&#39;ve been focusing so much on Colorado that I somehow missed the national pattern.  I&#39;ve been peeking at <a href="http://www.electoral-vote.com">www.electoral-vote.com</a> rather often lately.  Polls don&#39;t tell me much when I hear them on the radio or read them in print.  Watching them in a graphic adjusted according to electoral votes has been interesting.</p>

<p>Today they posted a new <a href="http://www.electoral-vote.com/info/2000.html">map of the 2000 election with voting breakdowns by county</a>.  Take a look at that map.  There&#39;s a pretty compelling correllation between population density and political party.  Seeing it on a map really hit me.</p>

<p>Until recently, I did not understand <a href="https://dobbse.net/thinair/2004/06/rural-voters.html">why rural Colorado generally votes for republican leaders despite consistent favoritism toward big corporations and the super-rich</a>.  My roots run three generations deep into rural Colorado soil, but I&#39;ve been voting democrat for years now.  I&#39;m finally starting to understand the descrepancy.  <a href="https://dobbse.net/thinair/2004/07/power-grab.html">The republican intelligentsia talk a good game about small government but their power-grabbing actions speak louder</a>.</p>

<p>I hope some of you folks who aren&#39;t living in cities or suburbs will reconsider your support for the Bush administration.  They are not who they pretend to be.</p>

<p>Eric - Please substantiate your claim of "consistent favortism toward big corporations and the super-rich".</p>

<p>In your reply, please do not forget to include definitions for "big corporations" and "super-rich".  Also, please provide a rough head count of the entities that meet your definition.</p>
