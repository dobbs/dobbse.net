<p>Many thanks to Chris Winters for <a href="http://cwinters.com/News/show/?news_id=709">mentioning bivio in a post last December</a>.  It was hard to ignore this quote:</p>

<blockquote><p>Superhero Rob Nagler <a href="http://www.bivio.biz/hm/csci3308-xp-intro/intro">presented his company&#39;s XP practices</a> to a college class last year and has the slides online. (If I lived in Boulder bivio would be my dream company to work for.).</p></blockquote>

<p>Thanks to Chris, I was paying extra attention when <a href="http://dobbse.net/thinair/2003/10/000149.html">I met Rob at frameworks-boulder a few months back</a>.  After several interviews, bivio offered me a job last week.  I&#39;m pretty excited about it.  First I need to put some finishing touches on my current project and see it into production.  In the meantime I&#39;ll be dusting off my collection of perl books.</p>

<p>I started blogging after I was laid off from PlanetCAD.  Fourteen months later there&#39;s clear professional benefits even if I&#39;m not on the A-list.  I&#39;m convinced my blog helped me land the current contract with Microcomputer Training Specialists and the City and County of Denver.  <a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0101170/">John is a blogger too</a>.  He no doubt appreciated getting a deeper glimpse into my interests and character.  During my interview process, Rob mentioned that there was some good stuff on my blog.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not that my blog got me hired for either of these jobs.  But it does give prospective clients or employers a lot more material on which to base their decisions.  They can get a much better sense of how I&#39;ll fit in with their team.</p>

<p>A fun anecdote from the interview process.  Rob never asked me for my resume.  I pair programmed with him for several hours and learned some new tricks immediately.  I had more traditional interviews with several other people on the team.  When he sent me the offer letter it had my old address on it.  &quot;How&#39;d he get that?&quot; I wondered.  Then I realized that I hadn&#39;t updated my resume since January and Sarah and I moved in July.  It more or less worked exactly like it should.  I didn&#39;t have to tell Rob where to find my resume.  He found my contact info there on his own.  If I&#39;d been keeping my resume up-to-date he would have gotten the correct contact info.  :-)</p>
