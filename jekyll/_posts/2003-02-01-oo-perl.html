<p>I've landed a contract programming gig.  One of the guys I'm working with is fresh out of college with a CS degree.  He seems to be a pretty good programmer, but inexperience and haste showed in the perl cgis he'd hacked together.  On Thursday afternoon I gave him a quick explanation of how to do objects in Perl.  He went home and spent four hours rewriting his CGIs into objects.</p>

<p>Three years ago at this time I couldn't figure out how to apply OO Perl to my own projects.  Partly, my one-shot data munjings didn't really need objects.  I knew how to use modules slurped from CPAN and I understood the syntax, and inheritance, encapsulation, polymorphism and so on.  I <em>understood</em> but I didn't <em>grok</em>.</p>

<p>Sometime between then and Thursday I grokked.</p>

<p>It tickles me to think that two years of Java and five months of occasional python hacking have helped me grok OO Perl.  Maybe I shouldn't be publicly bragging about it.  :-)  It's also fun to have a paid perl gig.</p>
