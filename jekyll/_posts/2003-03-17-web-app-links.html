<p>For the last week, amid job-hunting, I've been tinkering with Blosxom, MT, tiki text, textile, and Jon Udell's Docbase kit from <span class="book" style="text-decoration: underline;">Practical Internet Groupware</span>.  I'm trying to assemble some simple infrastructure for mostly spontaneous web app creation.  I want to get back to my tinkering, but also thought I'd post some links that are fueling my tinkering.</p>

On September 11, New York Police Department helicopter pilots reported their assessment that the towers were likely to collapse imminently, unaware that the firefighters in the buildings could not hear the transmissions.</blockquote></li>

As fire and heavy, black smoke were seen spewing from the 110-floor North Tower skyscraper at the World Trade Center (WTC), <strong>without instruction or guidance from authorities</strong>, vessels from tugboats to ferries in the harbor area that witnessed the incident changed their courses and headed directly for the closest docking areas to the WTC.
