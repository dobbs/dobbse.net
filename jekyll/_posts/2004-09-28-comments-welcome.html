<p>My sincere apologies if my comment moderation code has falsely accused you of trying to spam my web log.  I try to keep this small corner of the net mostly free from advertising.  My programatic censor has been a bit too aggressive since my last modification.  I really am interested in your comments and feel especially bad about this particular mistake.</p>
