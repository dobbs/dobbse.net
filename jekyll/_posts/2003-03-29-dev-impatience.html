<p>I've been tinkering with <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/pyblosxom/">pyblosxom</a> for the past week.  I have been test-driving a python variation on the <a href="http://www.raelity.org/apps/blosxom/plugins/input/writeback.individual">writeback plugin</a>.  After a week my interest is waning, partly because I've learned that one of the developers is working on a comment, trackback, and pingback combo.  And I wanted to be done with this already.</p>
