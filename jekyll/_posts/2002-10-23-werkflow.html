<p>When Bob asked about <a href="http://blogs.werken.com/people/bob/archives/000107.html#000107">Planning and Scheduling</a>, this sentence got my attention:<br>
</p><blockquote>I'm thinking along the lines of werkflow being use to drive your typical web-app, where you have almost enough database connections, etc.</blockquote><p></p>

<p>It looks like <a href="http://dobbse.net/reflection/2002/09/000057.html#werkflow-valves">one of the projects</a> I would like to pursue:<br>
</p><blockquote>Experiment with using Werkflow in place of the valves in Turbine 3.</blockquote><p></p>

<p>Bob's specific example of "almost enough database connections" made me think about definining rules to manage graceful ï»¿degradation of service under increasing load.</p>

<p>So much fun stuff to learn, so little time.</p>
