<p><a href="http://dobbse.net/thinair/2003/09/000140.html">State machines</a> part five</p>

<p>At the September meeting of <a href="http://www.frameworks-boulder.org/">frameworks-boulder</a> Tom Vilot, an artist and a geek, presented <a href="http://www.bivio.biz/hm/download-bOP">bOP</a>.   Rob Nagler, President of <a href="http://bivio.biz/">bivio</a> also showed up.  <a href="http://vilot.com/category-list?s=1">Tom&#39;s personal website</a> has interesting artwork. (I feel obliged to mention that there&#39;s some nudity -- exercise caution if you or anyone with a view of your screen is likely to be offended.)  <a href="http://PaintedSnapshot.com/">Tom&#39;s also got an interesting business</a> that you might check out.  I enjoyed his presentation of bOP.</p>

<p>The conversation with Rob afterwards was interesting enough that I ended up missing <a href="http://boulderjug.org/">BJUG</a>.  Tom had explained that &quot;bOP is written in very lispish perl&quot;.  Rob added that it makes heavy use of closures which is part of what makes it lispish.  I also saw some use of anonymous subroutines (lambdas in lisp) in the task configuration[1].  While talking about lisp and perl Rob asked if I&#39;d read <em>On Lisp</em>?  <a href="http://dobbse.net/thinair/2003/10/000148.html">I&#39;ve been reading it slowly for the past few months</a>.  Interesting timing.  Most relevant for this conversation,  a bOP application centers around a task configuration which happens to be a state transition table.</p>

<p>My intuition is ringing pretty loudly about this framework.  I haven&#39;t worked with it at all, but while I&#39;ve been looking more closely, everything I&#39;ve seen aligns with all of this state machinery.  Here&#39;s part of the example <a href="http://petshop.bivio.biz/src?s=Bivio::PetShop::Agent::TaskId">bOP Pet Store task configuration</a>.</p>

<pre>
sub get_delegate_info {
    my($proto) = @_;
    return $proto-&gt;merge_task_info($proto-&gt;SUPER::get_delegate_info, [
	...
	[qw(
	    PRODUCTS
	    500
	    GENERAL
	    ANYBODY
	    Model.ProductList-&gt;execute_load_all_with_query
	    View.products
	)],
	[qw(
	    ITEM_SEARCH
	    501
	    GENERAL
	    ANYBODY
	    Model.ItemSearchList-&gt;execute_load_page
            Model.ItemSearchListForm
	    View.search
            next=CART
	)],
	[qw(
	    ITEMS
	    502
	    GENERAL
	    ANYBODY
	    Model.ItemList-&gt;execute_load_all_with_query
	    Model.ItemListForm
	    View.items
	    next=CART
	)],
	[qw(
	    ITEM_DETAIL
	    503
	    GENERAL
	    ANYBODY
	    Model.Item-&gt;execute_load_parent
	    Model.Inventory-&gt;execute_load_parent
	    Model.ItemForm
	    View.item
	    next=CART
	)],
	[qw(
	    CART
	    504
	    GENERAL
	    ANYBODY
	    Model.CartItemList-&gt;execute_load_all
	    Model.CartItemListForm
	    View.cart
	    next=CART
	    want_query=0
	)],
	[qw(
	    CHECKOUT
	    505
	    GENERAL
	    ANYBODY
	    Model.CartItemList-&gt;execute_load_all
	    View.checkout
	)],
</pre><p>I don&#39;t know the mechanics behind it, but I&#39;m really interested in the lines that declare a relationship between Model and View and a given state.  It looks related to parts of <a href="http://research.sun.com/projects/ace/samples/NameTool/Nametool.aum">the Ace Application Usage Specification</a>.  Both appear to be declaring relationships between the state machine and the Model, though Ace is quite a bit more verbose.  Also, Ace is speculative research whereas bOP has been in production since 1999.</p>

<p>When I read <a href="http://dobbse.net/thinair/2003/10/000145.html">Bob Martin&#39;s chapter on the state pattern</a>, I immediately started imagining how that could be connected to a web app framework so I could get back to <a href="http://dobbse.net/thinair/2003/10/000142.html">thinking about web apps like I used to with Tango</a>.  By all initial inspection, it&#39;s already implemented in bOP, and bivio&#39;s taken further steps to make the model and security connections also declarative.  In fact, while explaining <a href="http://www.bivio.biz/hm/why-bOP">why you should consider bOP</a> bivio uses language similar to what I was saying about Tango:</p>

<blockquote><p>bOP&#39;s primary advantage is as an alternative model for web development. Application servers promote a page-centric model.  bOP&#39;s task-centric model allows you to think in terms of operations, not output (results).</p></blockquote>

<p>[1] anonymous subs are how you do closures in perl so these are probably the same thing.</p>
