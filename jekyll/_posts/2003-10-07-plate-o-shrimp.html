<p>The <em>plate &#39;o shrimp</em> phenomenon from <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0087995/quotes">Repo Man</a></p>

<blockquote><p>Miller : A lot o&#39; people don&#39;t realize what&#39;s really going on. They view life as a bunch o&#39; unconnected incidents &#39;n things. They don&#39;t realize that there&#39;s this, like, lattice o&#39; coincidence that lays on top o&#39; everything. Give you an example; show you what I mean: suppose you&#39;re thinkin&#39; about a plate o&#39; shrimp. Suddenly someone&#39;ll say, like, plate, or shrimp, or plate o&#39; shrimp out of the blue, no explanation. No point in lookin&#39; for one, either. It&#39;s all part of a cosmic unconsciousness. <br />

<p>I like to pay attention to coincidence.  If I notice a connection between otherwise random events, then there&#39;s something in that connection to examine more closely.  Not necessarily because of a cosmic unconsciousness, it&#39;s probably all just randomness.  But if my brain draws a connection, then there&#39;s something inside me that establishes a relationship between those events.  It&#39;s like a window into my subconscious.  For me, coincidence, d&eacute;ja vu, and intuitive zaps are all things that make me examine my experience more closely to see what pattern my brain is trying to draw to my attention.  I have never been disappointed by the results of such reflection.  And if there does happen to be a lattice &#39;o coincidence that lays on top o&#39; everything, at least I&#39;ll be paying attention to what&#39;s really going on.  ;)</p>

<p>I first saw Repo Man as a class requirement for &quot;Psychology of Architecture&quot; (pronounced &quot;psycho architecture&quot;) which had earned a reputation for aggressive mind games (hence the pronunciation).  I thrived in that class and came back as a teaching assistant for a couple semesters.  Among the other required movies were <a href="http://us.imdb.com/title/tt0076299/">The Last Wave</a> , <a href="http://us.imdb.com/title/tt0096895/">Batman</a> , <a href="http://us.imdb.com/title/tt0092117/">True Stories</a> , <a href="http://us.imdb.com/title/tt0083658/">Blade Runner</a> , and the 1984 colorized restoration of <a href="http://us.imdb.com/title/tt0017136/">Metropolis</a> .  That collection of movies was part of the appeal of the class for me.</p>
