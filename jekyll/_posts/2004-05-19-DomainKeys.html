<p>Yippie!  I get to tell you &quot;I told you so.&quot;</p>

<p>About this time last year I suggested using <a href="http://dobbse.net/thinair/2003/05/000111.html">digital identity on mail servers to cut down on spam</a>.  Yahoo! has added an excellent dimension with <a href="http://antispam.yahoo.com/domainkeys">DomainKeys</a>.  They suggest <span class="caps">IS</span>Ps publish their public keys via <span class="caps">DNS</span> since there are already control measures in place to ensure that only the domain owner can modify their <span class="caps">DNS</span> records.  Thanks to <a href="http://jeremy.zawodny.com/blog/archives/002010.html">Jeremy Zawodny</a> via <a href="http://simon.incutio.com/archive/2004/05/19/domainKeys">Simon Willison</a>.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not fool proof, but it immediately gives Yahoo! a leg up on their competition.  It will get harder for spammers to spoof Yahoo! addresses in the From: line.  And competition may compel others among the big <span class="caps">IS</span>Ps to adopt DomainKeys.  Basically, Yahoo! is a big enough player that their endorsement may encourage wider adoption of the technique.  I don&#39;t expect to see a drop in spam overnight, but it looks like a step in the right direction.</p>
