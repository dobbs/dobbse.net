<p>In the last year of my bachelor's degree, <a href="http://www.cudenver.edu/Aandp/people/folders/mccall/profile.html"><cite>Ray McCall</cite></a> said something that's stuck with me:  <q>the trick in life is keeping what's urgent from taking priority over what's important.</q>  <a href="http://blogs.werken.com/people/bob/archives/000164.html"> Bob's comments on Urgent and Important axes </a> is a more refined picture:<br />
<blockquote>I think the key to managing time effectively is finding the things that are both <b>urgent</b> and <b>important</b> and doing those.  Defer the items that aren't urgent and important.   I find I have the most mental stability when I accomplish things in the following priority order:<br />
<ol>  <li>Urgent and important</li>  <li>Important</li>  <li>Urgent</li>  <li>Luxury</li> </ol></blockquote></p>
