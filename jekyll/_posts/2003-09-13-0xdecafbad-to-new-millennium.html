<p>NetNewsWire brought me</p>

<p>I helped write &quot;the New Millennium based security and administration software&quot; that&#39;s mentioned in the product description.  In fact, that&#39;s what I was talking about when I got excited about <a href="http://dobbse.net/thinair/2003/02/000085.html">grokking OO Perl</a> .  I don&#39;t think I really did much more than help make some <span class="caps">HTML,</span> point at a couple web app concepts and give Ben an <span class="caps">OO</span> nudge.  New Millennium is a cool little company.  Ben and Todd are friends from <a href="http://boulder.asu.org">the dojo</a>.  It was a fun short gig.</p>
