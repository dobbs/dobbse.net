<p>At 7:56 pm <span class="caps">MST, </span>December 3, 2004, Sarah gave birth to our first child, a 7 pound, 19 1/2 inch baby boy.  Although the Boulder Community Foothills Hospital is a pretty great place to give birth, after two nights there, Sarah and I are delighted to be home with our new son.</p>

<p>My friend Jeff observed that Elliott has a pretty cool birthdate:  12-3-4 (of course that only works in the <span class="caps">US</span> locale.).</p>

<p>Let the sleep deprivation begin.  :-)</p>

<p><ins>Update:</ins> Corrected the birth date.  :-)  Maybe you all figured this out on your own, but Elliott was born on the 3rd, not the 12th as I originally published.  Did I mention sleep deprivation?</p>

<p>I was just browsing and reading, and for some reason happened to check your website to see what you were up to and found the good news!</p>

<p>Congratulations to you and your wife and welcome to the world of parenting !!!</p>

<p>Congrats to you both! Only three more and you'll be caught up to me :) Fatherhood is the coolest, but "lifestyle change" is the operative phrase here. Hope mom and baby are doing well. Come to think of it, my oldest was born on the 3rd as well, but he just turned 15!</p>
