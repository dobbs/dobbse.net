<p>I&#39;m rethinking the design of my blog visually, organizationally, and in instrumentation.  Well, I&#39;m also rethinking my career.  Hoping to focus my professional attention on computational education.  Those of you reading via the feeds, there&#39;s likely to be some churn as I rearrange things a bit.  I&#39;ll try to minimize the noise, but just in case I break something badly, you&#39;ll have had a little warning.</p>
