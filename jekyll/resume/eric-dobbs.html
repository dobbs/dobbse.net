                    <dt>Impact</dt><dd>
                        <p>Applied diplomacy and role-modeling to streamline communications and greatly increase collaboration between QA, Development, IT, and Solutions Delivery.</p>
                        <p>Increased productivity for 20 developers and 4 technicians.  Drastically reduced build times and deploy times while also increasing reliability.</p>
                        <p>Successfully lead adoption of Docker throughout the organization.</p>
                    </dd>

                    <dt>Leadership</dt><dd>
                        <p>Fostered deep respect and trust from my team.  The director of development received repeated requests that they remain on my team.  Several senior devs expressed specific interest in joining my team.
                        </p>
                        <p>Nurtured emotional safety and courage.  Established weekly retros and bi-weekly one-on-ones where we focused on social and emotional aspects of software development.  Modeled speaking hard truths and admissions of failure. Gave specific and concrete applause frequently.
                        </p>
                        <p>Impacted the entire development team when my fellow  managers also adopted retros and one-on-ones.</p>
                    </dd>

                    <dt>Mentorship</dt><dd>
                        <p>Successfully encouraged professional development in all levels of technical experience: high-school intern, junior dev fresh out of a code school, intermediate dev transitioning from QA to engineering, and two senior developers.</p>
                        <p>One exceeded their goal of submitting a proposal when their talk was not only accepted, but also well received at Rocky Mountain Ruby 2015.</p>
                    </dd>

                    <dt>DevOps</dt><dd>
                        <p>Reduced build times from 8 hours to 30 minutes by a combination of expanding the jenkins cluster from 20 to 70 VMs, and identifying and fixing the worst-offenders in the test suite.</p>
                        <p>Improved our deploys with significant increase in consistency and reducing time-to-deploy from one month to a few hours.  Instituted standardized deploy process with team-wide adoption of runbooks, and made semi-automated deploys into a consistent part of the software delivery life-cycle.</p>
                        <p>Social and technical engineering of Docker adoption. Enabled early adopters to experiment and learn containers in development.  Deployed first containers into our Continuous Integration cluster.  Created first containerized tests and deploys.  Designed and evangelized effective patterns of use.  Planned, negotiated, persuaded, and executed deployment in stages from dev, to test, QA, UAT, and production.</p>

                            Fostered a culture of continuous improvement through
                            honest and courageous communication, by speaking hard
                            truths, and applauding when others did the same.

                        <p>
                            Refactored all outbound messaging, the core purpose of the
                            software, into a delivery service without disrupting any
                            existing message flows.  Thanks to this layer of
                            abstraction, only two weeks later we were able to easily
                            improve throughput just in time for a customer's big
                            campaign messaging over 330,000 numbers.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Introduced a command dispatcher and handlers for message
                            processing.

                        <p>
                            Created a foundation for modularized html, css, and
                            javascript which enabled migration of the existing UI from
                            a home-grown CSS-soup to Bootstrap.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Refactored one particularly messy controller with just a
                            handful of method extractions.  A few weeks later those
                            changes enabled a colleague to clarify the routing and
                            models and complete the cleanup without me.

                            Identified garbage collection and IO as primary
                            bottlenecks.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Threaded message delivery for an immediate twelvefold
                            increase in SMS message throughput.  Introduced retries
                            and fallbacks to ensure message logging and persistance
                            and expand the ability to identify and diagnose failures.

                        <p>
                            Enabled message workers to run under JRuby as a strategic
                            move to open other performance opportunities via JVM based
                            tools and languages.

                            testing core business logic.  Number of test files grew

                            systems administrators to senior embedded systems
                            programmers.  Also created the overall training plan and
                            most of the supporting documentation.  Received strong

                            Saved face for the company when the president forgot a
                            meeting with the biggest client.  Took his place offering
                            valuable contributions around complex design and security
                            issues.  Client was seriously impressed with my ability to
                            step in unprepared and to turn a potential train wreck
                            into a productive meeting.
