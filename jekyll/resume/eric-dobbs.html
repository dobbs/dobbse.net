          <strong>Learning From Incidents .</strong>
          Developed, practiced, and mentored teammates in cognitive interviewing, generating and synthesizing themes, facilitating productive retrospectives, and narrative composition and graphic representation.
We produced 30 internal incident reports digging deep into social and technical details all over the software ecosystem. Most reports featured interactions between systems managed by multiple teams. Many reports involved challenges between internal platforms, vendor platforms, or partner platforms.
We facilitated learning review meetings for each of the internal reports. Most of those meetings were attended by a diverse cross-section of the company including many people who had not been directly responders.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Change Management.</strong>

Crowd-sourced a list of over 50 migration projects and thereby catalyzed the creation of a tiger team and program to manage migrations for platforms, languages, and library upgrades.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Collaboration &amp; Mentorship.</strong>
          Coordinated messaging with a company-wide training program transforming the product management practice at the company to improve alignment between reliability and product.
Mentored 2 staff engineers and 2 senior engineers on my own team, led the community of practice of principal site reliability engineers.
Advised many technical fellows, senior managers, directors, and some VPs in the nuances of our complex systems and especially through the sociotechnical lens.

        <p>
          <strong>Cross-team Coordination.</strong>
          Led chaos engineering experiments (including the first in production), from developing experience across the organization, negotiating organizational buy-in, and synthesizing cross-team expertise into concrete experiment design.

Social engineering and evangelism for changes to policy around incident tracking, metrics collection and reporting, team health, and incident retros.

Helped write and organize Service Level Objectives documentation and tooling.

        <p>
          <strong>Emergent Design.</strong>
          Refactored all outbound messaging into a delivery service while maintaining existing message flows. This abstraction only two weeks later enabled us to improve throughput just in time for a customer's campaign messaging over 330,000 numbers.
Created a foundation for modularized html, css, and javascript enabling migration UI from home-grown CSS-soup to Bootstrap.


                          Refactored one particularly messy controller with just a
                          handful of method extractions.  A few weeks later those
                          changes enabled a colleague to clarify the routing and
                          models and complete the cleanup without me.

        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Scale.</strong>

                          Profiled outbound messaging performance and throughput.
                          Identified garbage collection and IO as primary
                          bottlenecks.

Threaded message delivery for an immediate twelvefold increase in SMS message throughput. Introduced retries and fallbacks to ensure message logging and persistence and expand the ability to identify and diagnose failures.

                          Enabled message workers to run under JRuby as a strategic
                          move to open other performance opportunities via JVM based
                          tools and languages.

        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Front-end Engineering.</strong>

                          Streamlined unit testing of javascript front end code

                          thermometer and pledge wall for use in high-profile gala
                          events.  Produced the SVG graphic for dynamic display and
                          employed Ember.js for updates.
