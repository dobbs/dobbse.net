                          Refactored all outbound messaging, the core purpose of the
                          software, into a delivery service without disrupting any
                          existing message flows.  Thanks to this layer of
                          abstraction, only two weeks later we were able to easily
                          improve throughput just in time for a customer's big
                          campaign messaging over 330,000 numbers.

                      <p>
                          Introduced a command dispatcher and handlers for message
                          processing.

                      <p>
                          Created a foundation for modularized html, css, and
                          javascript which enabled migration of the existing UI from
                          a home-grown CSS-soup to Bootstrap.

                      <p>
                          Refactored one particularly messy controller with just a
                          handful of method extractions.  A few weeks later those
                          changes enabled a colleague to clarify the routing and
                          models and complete the cleanup without me.

                      <p>
                          Threaded message delivery for an immediate twelvefold
                          increase in SMS message throughput.  Introduced retries
                          and fallbacks to ensure message logging and persistance
                          and expand the ability to identify and diagnose failures.

                      <p>
                          Enabled message workers to run under JRuby as a strategic
                          move to open other performance opportunities via JVM based
                          tools and languages.
