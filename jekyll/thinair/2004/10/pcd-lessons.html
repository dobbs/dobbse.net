<p><a href="http://dobbse.net/thinair/2003/09/000140.html">State machines</a> part eleven</p>

<p><em>These were my first rambling thoughts about workflow from June of 2002.  (Maybe I should call this "part zero". :-)  I haven't looked at Commons workflow nor Turbine's pipeline since then.  The code has probably diverged from my UML diagrams.</em></p>

<p>A summary of what I've learned over the past couple
years of working on PlanetCAD's workflow and paying
attention to other options.</p>

<p>I think there are several different things that get
described as "workflow".  I think of them as different
use cases for a general workflow engine.</p>

<ol>
<li>There's the wizard interface that organizes a
complex form into multiple steps (or pages, or screens,
or whatever).  This is what commons-workflow is
primarily about.</li>

<li>There's the business process automation where a
purchase order must have quotes from three different
suppliers, reviewed by someone in management, further
reviewed by someone in purchasing, and finally the PO
is cut and delivered to the winning supplier.</li>

<li>Complex processing of data without human
intervention.  The stuff we're doing at PlanetCAD is
automating the preparation, processing, and delivery of
engineering data between manufacturers and their
suppliers.  I like to describe this as a distributed
batch processing system.  A sysadmin sets up the
scripts that will be used for processing.  When an end
user sends a collection of engineering files to another
user, the destination user's profile determines which
of the scripts get used for processing.  The scripts
are run without human intervention by a collection of
job servers.  A workflow state machine manages the
processing of the script.</li>
</ol>

<p><em>As you might guess from the rest of the entries in this series, I now see applications for workflow everywhere.</em></p>

<p>Clearly, some workflow systems would be a natural
combination of these things.  I think that Jason's use
case of the lifecycle of a book will probably be a
combination of 2 and 3.  In fact, we have a couple
cases where our automated workflow pauses to wait for a
human to approve what's been done so far.  We started
with 3 and are adding elements of 2 as they are
requested.  I'm not as interested in 1, but I've seen
some discussion on the commons lists about using
commons workflow for some of these other kinds of
workflow, so I have been including it in my thinking.</p>

<p><em>The original audience for whom I wrote this knew what I meant by "Jason's use case."  For the rest of you, Jason van Zyl described the process a book goes through in editing and production -- something important for <a href="http://tambora.zenplex.org/">tambora</a>.  </em></p>

<h3>Commons Workflow (figure 1):</h3>

<p>An Activity (or wizard) is a collection of steps.
There's a composite called Block that allows steps to
be arbitrarily nested.  Blocks are also used to model
'if', 'for', and 'where' type operations.  There's some
plans to add a Process which is a collection of
Activities.  The existing code handles wizards.
'Process' would be needed to add support for workflows
between people (type 2) or workflows between systems
(type 3).  A Context is provided at runtime as
processing flows through a defined Activity.  Decisions
through the workflow are made based on objects in the
Context.</p>


<h3>Turbine's Pipeline (figure 2):</h3>

<p>Looks pretty similar to Commons Workflow, though a
little more simple.  A Pipeline is a collection of
valves.  The pipeline is defined with an XML file not
unlike the default means of configuring Steps in an
Activity in Workflow.  At runtime RunData and
ValveContext are provided as processing flows through
the Pipeline.  There's no composite patter like the
Workflow Block, but the rest is pretty similar.</p>


<h3>State design pattern (figure 3):</h3>

<p>I think this turns the Pipeline model inside out.
Instead of having a context and moving it through a
pipeline, client code talks to the context and it
changes states through subsequent calls.  Context is
the object that client code talks to and the behavior
of that Context changes as the state of the Context
changes.  PlanetCAD's workflow uses a State pattern.
It's worked pretty well for us but it seems to invite
some coupling between the State objects and the
Context.  And we're also seeing some proliferation of
pretty similar states.</p>

<h3>Event model:</h3>

<p>The asynchronous nature of a business process workflow
(type 2 above) invites some thinking about making the
workflow event driven, which is what I've been doing
for the past several weeks.  In this case the
individual Steps or Valves or States would be decoupled
and made independent.  Then the workflow would be a
network of listeners that trigger a particular
processing step including access to contextual info in
the invocation.  When processing completes an event
would be fired to indicate its completion and some
other step could be listening for that event.  You
could still use an XML descriptor to define the network
of listeners and the rules that govern different paths
through the network.  But I think making the steps more
loosely coupled opens the opportunity to change the
workflow at runtime.  That would allow ad-hoc workflows
to be created, or existing workflows to be changed on
the fly to handle exceptions in the standard process.</p>

<p>I also like the potential for letting completely
different systems trigger events in the network.  I
haven't quite gotten my head around this one yet, which
is why I haven't included an illustration.  Seems like
the same sort of mental transition to event driving
programming and GUIs.  The elements start to look like
they aren't doing enough, but the effect of a whole
bunch of them orchestrated by the user makes cool
things happen.  In the workflow stuff I'm working on,
it pushes a lot of the magic into how the network of
listeners is organized how the rules in the network
interact with one another to control flow through the
network.</p>

<p><em>These decoupled states waiting for asynchronous events could even be web services in a pipeline, if you accept my theory that a pipeline is just an inside-out workflow.  I still think there are interesting parallels between the asynchronous event-driven processing of GUI applications and similar asynchronous event-driven processing in Service Oriented Architectures.  I don't think its any coincidence that SOAs and pipelines are getting some buzz these days.  Finally, I'm still interested in a workflow engine supporting ad-hoc workflows.</em></p>
