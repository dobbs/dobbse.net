<h1><a href="http://dobbse.net/thinair/2004/04/t1.html">Diplomacy of troubleshooting and the telecom alphabet soup: T1, CRC errors, ESF, B8ZS, HDSL, CSU/DSU, clock source</a></h1>
<div class="time 2004-04-21T13:20:50 pubdate meta">Wednesday 21 April 2004 at 13:20 </div>
<blockquote><p>This story is about the diplomacy of troubleshooting and the art of asking good questions.  It is also a parable about the value of non-conflict.  The telecom alphabet soup in the title is for the search engines so that people who are actually troubleshooting can just skip ahead to <a href="http://dobbse.net/thinair/2004/04/t1.html#solution">our solution to CRC errors on a T1 line</a>.</p></blockquote>

<p>bivio has a new office, but no one works there yet.  We renovated because the place was a mess but we liked the location.  We added new carpet, fresh paint, a kitchen, a server room, and enclosed one additional office.  We also took out one wall in the office we&#39;ll use for ourselves -- the rest we plan to sublet.  It&#39;s vastly improved except for one crucial detail: getting internet access has been a fiasco.</p>

<p>Our production systems are in a colocation facility in South Denver.  We have a <span class="caps">T1</span> line running from there to the basement of Rob&#39;s house.  Our development systems are in the basement, along with some big disk arrays and a tape robot for backups and an incredibly heavy printer.  The plan was to move the <span class="caps">T1</span> line and our systems from Rob&#39;s basement to the office.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not as if a leased <span class="caps">T1</span> line is some bleeding edge networking technology.  We know a <span class="caps">T1</span> has been in our office before -- the previous tenants appear to have been tele-marketers.  Moving our <span class="caps">T1</span> ought to be entirely painless, even trivial for the telco, right?  That assumption was our first mistake.</p>

<p>We scheduled the cutover, moved the computers and waited for the packets to start flowing.  Instead our routers reported <span class="caps">CRC</span> errors.  Lots of <span class="caps">CRC</span> errors.  About 5000 errors per second.</p>

<p>Rob was on the phone with technicians and management from the telco and our colocation facility for two-and-a-half days alternately doing the angry-customer-rant or helping to troubleshoot the problem.  When no progress was in sight on the third day, we moved the computers back to the basement.</p>

<p>But the office <em>looks</em> great, really.</p>

<h3>The blame game</h3>

<p>Our telco resells Qwest&#39;s wires for &quot;the last mile&quot; to Rob&#39;s house and otherwise runs their own phone cloud from Boulder to our colocation facility.  A tech came out to our office and put his test gear on the line.  No errors whatsoever.  &quot;Must be your routers.&quot;</p>

<p>For five years our routers happily traded packets over the existing line in Rob&#39;s basement.  We know they work and we know they work with the telco&#39;s cloud.  Rob finally got fed up with the blame-the-router solution and dragged the tech over to his house to demonstrate that the router works from his basement.  It worked flawlessly.</p>

<p>The next stop was the telco&#39;s facility in Boulder to isolate Qwest from the test.  <span class="caps">CRC</span> errors piled on.  Seemed pretty clear to us.  It&#39;s not the routers, but a provisioning problem.  So, what&#39;s different between the line to Rob&#39;s basement and the line to the new office?</p>

<p>Pursuing that question was the second mistake.</p>

<p>It turns out there is a difference: <span class="caps">HDSL.  </span>We demonstrated that the routers were not the problem.  Their test gear &quot;demonstrated&quot; that the line was not the problem.  &quot;Must be that <span class="caps">HDSL.</span>&quot;  But we failed to get the routers working in their facility.  We hadn&#39;t determined that the problem was in the one of those segments.  In fact we had actually isolated those segments from the problem.  Rob tried really hard to make this point and steer them away from the <span class="caps">HDSL</span> red herring, but it was like trying to stop a train wreck.  They were convinced it was the <span class="caps">HDSL.</span></p>

<p>Rob&#39;s house is a long way from the central office.  <span class="caps">HDSL</span> can cover the distance.  There&#39;s nothing about <span class="caps">HDSL</span> that would cause the <span class="caps">CRC</span> errors.  And <span class="caps">HDSL</span> wouldn&#39;t explain why the router didn&#39;t work in their facility.  Nevertheless, they requested <span class="caps">HDSL</span> be added to the line to the office and Qwest told them it would be five days.</p>

<blockquote><p>Belief is incredibly powerful.  Given evidence which conflicts with belief, we will sooner dismiss the evidence than change what we believe.</p></blockquote>

<h3>Any other options?</h3>

<p>While our telco waited for Qwest, we investigated alternatives.  The options included cable and <span class="caps">DSL.  </span>Comcast offers cable service in our area, but the upstream bandwidth is limited to 384Kbps and you only get five static <span class="caps">IP</span> addresses.  We might be able to work within the bandwidth limits, but need more than five static addresses.  <span class="caps">DSL</span> won&#39;t work in our location.  Qwest tells us there&#39;s 26 gauge wire between their central office and our office -- there&#39;s too much signal loss.  They could maybe get 256Kbps to outside the building, but they don&#39;t think it would reach inside the building at all.</p>

<p>Our telco had not contacted us at all and we had no viable alternative so we got back on their case again last week.  Qwest hadn&#39;t gotten back to them about the <span class="caps">HDSL.  </span>Rob and I were finally talking with their lead <span class="caps">T1</span> tech.  A technician he knew at Qwest thought we couldn&#39;t even get <span class="caps">HDSL</span> at our location.  (Of course we knew that already :-) But no one had a good theory about how <span class="caps">HDSL</span> was going to stop the <span class="caps">CRC</span> errors anyway.</p>

<h3>Beginner&#39;s mind and language handshaking</h3>

<p>Most of the time I&#39;m very good at keeping my ego out of the way of solving problems.  My most important tool is investigative questions.  I assume that I don&#39;t know what I&#39;m talking about and hope that someone among us does.  <span class="caps">I </span><em>trust</em> that if we can put our heads together we can discover a solution.  Questions are powerful, but hostile questions are off limits.  For example, &quot;What the hell are you thinking?&quot;  &quot;Are you out of you&#39;re mind?&quot;  &quot;Do you even know what your doing?&quot;  &quot;Why haven&#39;t you tried <span class="caps">XYZ</span>?&quot;  Bad questions.  They divide us.  I&#39;ll illustrate some better ones below.</p>

<p>As with all technical problems there were two important dimensions.  Our primary obstacle was in the egos of all the people involved.</p>

<blockquote><p>No one wants to take the blame when things are going disastrously wrong.  There&#39;s nothing like a problem to bring out the worst in people&#39;s fears.  This is why the blame game is so common.</p></blockquote>

<p>Assuming beginner&#39;s mind is powerful because it lets everyone remain an expert.  <a href="http://www.nokama.com/tao/index.cfm?fuseaction=chapter&amp;ch=20">Give up learning, and put an end to your troubles</a>. I&#39;m not challenging anyone&#39;s authority or expertise.  I&#39;m not trying to affix blame.  There&#39;s no power conflict.  I&#39;m just trying to understand whatever is necessary to solve the technical problem.</p>

<p>Our technical problem was <span class="caps">CRC</span> errors.</p>

<p>The lead tech drove out from Denver on Friday afternoon with a Cisco router borrowed from our colocation people.  I met him at their Boulder facility with our router (a Lucent Pipeline 130).  Unable to get our Pipeline 130 working in their facility, we tried getting the Cisco router configured.  When the passwords they had given us failed, we got the colocation tech support on the phone.  That turned out to be a really good thing to do.  The telco tech had no router foo.  My router foo has seven years of rust.  The colocation tech had strong router foo.  Back to being a beginner.</p>

<p>Remembering that telco people speak a different language, I had reviewed the Pipeline docs trying to refresh my vocabulary.  It&#39;s tough to ask good questions if you don&#39;t speak with the same jargon.  Without a language handshake you&#39;ll just talk right past each other -- there will be no real communication.  Did <em>leased lines</em> mean anything?  <em>Nailed-up</em>?  Nope and nope.  I remembered that <em>framing</em> and <em>encoding</em> would mean something.  Turns out those were the only parameters the telco tech could really twiddle as far as provisioning the lines.  The previous line, the new line and our routers were all set up for <span class="caps">ESF</span> and <span class="caps">B8ZS.  </span>That wasn&#39;t our problem.  What about <em>channelization</em>?  That word he recognized.  The new <span class="caps">T1</span> line was not channelized.</p>

<p>Earlier in the conversation, the telco tech had drawn a picture of the major components in their cloud between the colocation facility and our office.  The only thing that was changing was the end point.  All the other links would stay the same.  None of the links were channelized.  &quot;How about in the colocation facility?  What&#39;s happening between the telco&#39;s <span class="caps">OC3</span> into that facility and our cabinet?  Were they expecting a channelized <span class="caps">T1</span>?&quot;  These are good questions because they are informational and non-threatening.  There&#39;s no blame implicit in the answer.  These questions can draw us together, hopefully toward a solution.</p>

<p>According to the colocation tech, almost all data communications use channelized connections.  Maybe that was our problem.  We know the telco isn&#39;t channelizing but that the routers almost certainly expect channels.  &quot;What&#39;s responsible for channelizing?&quot;  It&#39;s important to ask what <em>device</em> is responsible as opposed to <em>who</em> is responsible.  Again the questions do two things: draw us together rather than divide us, and focus on the technical problem.</p>

<p>Turns out that&#39;s the <span class="caps">CSU</span>/DSU.  Those are built into our routers.  In days gone by the <span class="caps">CSU</span>/DSU was a separate device.  Our Pipeline 130 includes one as does the Cisco competitor.  The router I&#39;d brought with me and the one in our cabinet at the colo were configured identically, except for the <span class="caps">IP</span> addresses.  Both were expecting channels in the <span class="caps">T1.  I</span> said this bit out loud to explain that channelization didn&#39;t appear to be our problem.  But it triggered a crucial insight from the colocation tech -- while he explained channelization he mentioned the all important clock source.</p>

<h3><a name="solution">Timing is everything</a></h3>

<p>Neither of our routers were providing a clock source.  A little telecom review is in order.  <span class="caps">T1</span> lines are also called DS1s.  <span class="caps">CSU</span>/DSUs channelize the <span class="caps">DS1</span> into 24 DS0s each providing 64Kbps bandwidth for a total of 1,536Kbps.  Channelization gives you the option to split your <span class="caps">T1</span> line -- part can be used for data and part for voice.  Each <span class="caps">DS0</span> could be a uniquely numbered plain old phone line, or they could be used for data.  In our case it&#39;s all data.  But it helps to know why lines get channelized at all.</p>

<p>The channels are created by time-division multiplexing.  A few milliseconds of data are sent for the first channel, then a few milliseconds for the second channel, then a few for the third and so on through all twenty-four channels.  Then they start over at the first channel.  In traditional telecommunications this allows a bunch of different voice conversations to be carried over the same pair of wires.  The phone cloud can divide and reassemble the conversations faster than we can hear -- we perceive no interruptions.  The other <span class="caps">CSU</span>/DSU reassembles the streams -- demultiplexes them.  We&#39;re splitting seconds here so if the clocks on the two <span class="caps">CSU</span>/DSUs are not in sync, no data will pass through.  The line will pass all the tests offered by telco testing equipment.  But no data will flow.  The routers will be dancing to different beats.  The music will be discord.  Our routers were not syncing.</p>

<p>When I configured the router I&#39;d brought with me to provide a clock source we were finally able to route data across the <span class="caps">T1</span> line.  Ping!  We then confirmed that the new configuration worked from our office as well.  Whatever the problem was, the solution was to configure one of the routers to provide a clock source.</p>

<h3>The Blame</h3>

<p>We had a solution to the technical problem.  Unfortunately it came too late on Friday.  Rob is gone this week and we didn&#39;t want to risk moving the computers again without him.  We&#39;re stuck waiting another week.</p>

<p>My last question while I was at the telco&#39;s facility turned out to be threatening, though not intentionally.  &quot;So how did they work for five years without either of them providing the clock source?&quot;  I was trying to ask another investigative question, but there were other questions implied: &quot;Who blew it?  Why didn&#39;t someone look for the clock source weeks ago?&quot;  Those implied questions were threatening.</p>

<p>Speculations included &quot;Maybe they were close enough to being in sync to work.  Maybe we hadn&#39;t been getting our full potential out of the line all these years.  Maybe <span class="caps">HDSL</span> includes a clock source.&quot;  These answers didn&#39;t satisfy, but I left it alone because we had a solution to the technical problem and I hadn&#39;t intended to send us back into the defensive finger-pointing.  We switched the line back to Rob&#39;s basement and scheduled time for our move next week.</p>

<p>The docs about the router&#39;s clock source mention that the phone system can provide the clock source.  In that case our routers were configured correctly -- both routers accepting the clock source from the cloud.  The telco tech says they never provide a clock source as a matter of policy.  If that&#39;s the case then someone must have made an exception to that policy when the line to the basement was installed.  Remember, we&#39;re splitting seconds here.  Partly out-of-sync is out-of-sync and no data will flow.  The <span class="caps">HDSL</span> providing a clock source is the most plausible speculation.  And Qwest might be providing a clock source separately from the <span class="caps">HDSL.  </span>Regardless, I&#39;d say that clock source is part of the provisioning:  framing, encapsulation <strong>and</strong> clock source.  If it&#39;s Qwest, then the blame still falls in our telco&#39;s lap because they are reselling Qwest lines.</p>

<p>I expect our telco will continue to blame the routers.  The finger-pointing will continue, but at least we will be able to move into our new office next week.</p>

<h1><a href="http://dobbse.net/thinair/2004/04/ellie.html">Life, Death, Zen, and the Art of Household Maintenance</a></h1>
<div class="time 2004-04-06T09:40:32 pubdate meta">Tuesday 06 April 2004 at 09:40 </div>
<p>For seven months Sarah and I lived in my one-bedroom condo without our dog, Ellie.  We had been in a fairly expensive lease on a two-bedroom apartment.  After I was laid off we were unable to get out of the lease but moved into my condo as soon as it expired.  That cut our housing expenses in half but meant Ellie had to stay somewhere else -- the homeowner&#39;s association forbids dogs and refused my request for an exception.</p>

<p>We saved quite a bit of money.  When I found a steady contract with the City and County of Denver we considered buying a house.  We started looking for one after I was hired by bivio.  To our delight, we closed on a house in North Boulder on Tuesday morning, March 30.  We were especially excited to have a yard suitable for Ellie.</p>

<p>That afternoon we learned she has cancer.  The wind poured out of our sails.</p>

<p>As the week progressed we learned progressively worse news about Ellie&#39;s condition.  She has either leukemia or lymphoma. The cancer is in her bone marrow, liver, spleen, and lymphatic system.  The oncologists wouldn&#39;t get specific but she may live only another month or so.  The timing feels especially painful -- this wasn&#39;t how we&#39;d planned it.</p>

<p>We packed most of our stuff Friday.  Mom packed our clothes and plants on Saturday while Sarah and several of my friends moved us out of the condo and moved the rest of our stuff out of storage.  Saturday night and Sunday we unpacked the bedroom, bathroom, and kitchen.  Last night we pushed the stuff piled in the living room to the edges making the space usable.  We don&#39;t have phone service yet and I won&#39;t know if my <span class="caps">DSL</span> can be transferred until the line is lit up.  This afternoon Sarah is picking Ellie up.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been emotionally divided.  I really like our new place.  It felt good to scrub the cupboards and cut shelf liners to fit them.  In the right state of mind housework can be spiritually purifying.  I learned this trick from Aikido.  Someone once described cleaning the dojo as sacred practice of maintaining what is fundamentally a sacred space.  Part of Aikido is a spiritual practice and therefore the dojo is also our sanctuary.</p>

<blockquote><p>Cynic: how disingenuous and manipulative!<br />
 <br />
Optimist: what magic to transform the mundane into the sacred!</p></blockquote>

<p>While I cleansed the shelves, I worked some of the house into my muscles.  Meanwhile I carried the weight of Ellie&#39;s condition.  I felt hurried with little time to spare.  I argued with myself.  The past seven months were lost and wasted.  But we wouldn&#39;t have this house had we not saved so much money.  If I could place a value on the time with Ellie, would the money we&#39;ve saved be worth it?  If it were possible, would I trade this house to heal Ellie?  I would have chosen differently had I known.  But I didn&#39;t know and those choices are locked in the past.  What now?</p>

<p>On Friday I met a woman who hopes to establish a counseling practice in Boulder targeting elderly people and adult children with elderly parents.  In a brief conversation about my Dad (another story) she shared an idea that has been mixing into the cleansing and argument.  She thinks we overlook the <em>privilege</em> of assisting our parents through their aging.  It is a sacred blessing in life, like giving birth to children and raising them.  What a radical departure from the prevailing sense of burden and fear in aging and death.</p>

<blockquote><p>Cynic: what a nasty guilt trip!  Between the lines she shames you for feeling burdened.<br />
 <br />
Optimist: what magic to transform a burden into something sacred!</p></blockquote>

<p>As I write, a sense of purpose emerges from the mixture.  Our cleansing and preparations are making this house into a home -- a sacred place for Ellie to enjoy in her final fleeting moments in this life. I expect painful but precious time ahead.  What we learn from Ellie will also prepare us for our parents&#39; journey to their deaths and perhaps better prepare us for our own.</p>
