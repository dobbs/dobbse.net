<span class="title">New job with bivio and giving thanks for blogs</span>

<p>Many thanks to Chris Winters for <a href="http://cwinters.com/News/show/?news_id=709">mentioning bivio in a post last December</a>.  It was hard to ignore this quote:</p>

<blockquote><p>Superhero Rob Nagler <a href="http://www.bivio.biz/hm/csci3308-xp-intro/intro">presented his company's XP practices</a> to a college class last year and has the slides online. (If I lived in Boulder bivio would be my dream company to work for.).</p></blockquote>

<p>Thanks to Chris, I was paying extra attention when <a href="http://dobbse.net/thinair/2003/10/000149.html">I met Rob at frameworks-boulder a few months back</a>.  After several interviews, bivio offered me a job last week.  I'm pretty excited about it.  First I need to put some finishing touches on my current project and see it into production.  In the meantime I'll be dusting off my collection of perl books.</p>

<p>I started blogging after I was laid off from PlanetCAD.  Fourteen months later there's clear professional benefits even if I'm not on the A-list.  I'm convinced my blog helped me land the current contract with Microcomputer Training Specialists and the City and County of Denver.  <a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0101170/">John is a blogger too</a>.  He no doubt appreciated getting a deeper glimpse into my interests and character.  During my interview process, Rob mentioned that there was some good stuff on my blog.</p>

<p>It's not that my blog got me hired for either of these jobs.  But it does give prospective clients or employers a lot more material on which to base their decisions.  They can get a much better sense of how I'll fit in with their team.</p>

<p>A fun anecdote from the interview process.  Rob never asked me for my resume.  I pair programmed with him for several hours and learned some new tricks immediately.  I had more traditional interviews with several other people on the team.  When he sent me the offer letter it had my old address on it.  &quot;How'd he get that?&quot; I wondered.  Then I realized that I hadn't updated my resume since January and Sarah and I moved in July.  It more or less worked exactly like it should.  I didn't have to tell Rob where to find my resume.  He found my contact info there on his own.  If I'd been keeping my resume up-to-date he would have gotten the correct contact info.  :-)</p>

<span class="title">Note to self:  Leave the TiBook at home on ski days</span>

<p>Just in case I ever get the urge to do some hacking on the way to skiing...</p>

<p><a href="http://doc.weblogs.com/2003/11/03#ipodOnlyIfliesTo10kFeet">Doc Searls pointed</a> to a post about <a href="http://www.rds.com/doug/weblogs/2003/10/31.html#a1091">iPods dying out at altitude</a>.</p>

<blockquote><p>Update from Stephen Pierce, a fellow pilot:....Hard drives work by levitating a head a very small distance from the media; unlike floppy or tape, where the media actually touches the head. The distance between the rotating media and the head is regulated using a very small wing on the head. The head literally 'flys' above the media.<br />
 <br />
When the pressure inside the drive is reduced, the wing will need a higher angle of attack, until finally the wing stalls, and the head impacts the media. The term in the industry for this behavior is called a 'head crash'. Very apropos, no?</p></blockquote>

<p>I knew the part about the flying disk heads, but hadn't thought about the effects of air pressure on them.  According to the post, iPods have a 10,000 foot altitude limit.  I know that most of the parking lots for Colorado ski areas are below that.  While writing up this post I got distracted hunting for more specific numbers than my memory was producing: Loveland around 12,000 and Vail Pass (not the ski area) a bit over 10,000.</p>

<p>After a number of pokes at google I finally found what I was looking for:  <a href="http://members.aol.com/crockeraf/ncconet.htm">a nice table which includes the altitudes of various Colorado ski areas</a>.  That page turns out to be part of <a href="http://members.aol.com/crockeraf/">a pretty thorough bit of coverage about North American ski areas in general</a>.  It's fun how the 'Net can still surprise me.</p>

<p>The data isn't perfect.  I was specifically interested in Loveland, where I spent many weekends in my childhood trying to keep up with my dad and his buddies on ski patrol.  <a href="http://www.skiloveland.com/skiareastatistic.htm">Loveland's stats</a> boast a higher altitude (12,700') than what shows up in the table (12,280').  That particular detail is important for some home-town rivalry.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.arapahoebasin.com/">Arapahoe Basin</a> and Loveland are on opposite sides of the Continental Divide and opposite sides of Loveland Pass.  Every year they are the last areas to close at the end of the season, with A-Basin usually winning by closing slightly later.  For some years they went back and forth over who had the highest ski lift.  Each would move their top lift up a little higher to beat the other.  Loveland has been the current leader since they put the top of lift 9 right on the Continental Divide.  That lift is often closed because of high winds on the ridge.  But when it is open there's an amazing view and some pretty fun skiing.</p>

<p>This whole diversion has been really fun for me.  I'm frankly surprised to discover such an interest in altitude.[1]  This post was supposed to just be a quick note to self.  Yet I've spent a couple hours researching and editing.</p>

<p>Looking more closely, it's clearly a part of Colorado culture.  For those of you who aren't third-generation natives of Colorado, here are some examples.  Many people know that Denver's nickname is the Mile High city, and that the Bronco's play football at Mile High Stadium, because the city of Denver is one mile above sea-level.  Along the same theme, there's a local magazine named 5280 [2].  Seventy-five percent of the terrain in the <span class="caps">US</span> that is over 10,000 feet is within Colorado.  At the borders of most <span class="caps">US</span> towns you'll find a road sign which proudly displays the population.  Colorado towns generally display the elevation.  I have many memories of how my dad would cuss at drivers from neighboring states: &quot;Gawdamn flatlanders!&quot;  Another one of Dad's classic observations, &quot;the lowest point in Colorado is higher than the highest point in Nebraska&quot; (or Oklahoma or Kansas or ...).[3]  The boiling point of water is lower than 100 degrees Celsius here in Colorado.  My mom spent years refining her recipe for pop-overs so they would pop correctly up here.</p>

<p>Anyway, it's been fun meandering from geeky details about hard drives and air pressure to Colorado trivia.</p>

<p>[1] Surprise?  Maybe I'm suffering from lack of oxygen.  :-)  After all, <a href="http://dobbse.net/thinair/2002/09/000012.html">I did name my blog thinair on purpose</a>.<br />
[2] If you generally work in metric units, you might not know that <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=1+mile+in+feet">there are 5280 feet in a mile</a>.  <br />
[3] I don't know if that's true.  Just something Dad often says.</p>

<p><a href="http://dobbse.net/thinair/2003/09/000140.html">State machines</a> part six</p>

<p><a href="http://www.denverjug.org/events/oct2003.html">David Geary presented an overview of JavaServer Faces at DJUG</a> on Wednesday.  I have to agree with his assessment that JavaServer Faces will be The Next Big Thing in java web app development.  Interestingly, it looks like <span class="caps">JSF</span> will be notably similar to bOP.</p>

<p><span class="caps">JSF</span> will be Java's answer to .NET and especially VisualStudio.  Some of the big players in the Java world are going to put a lot of marketing muscle behind it.  David mentioned that his book is going to be competing with a stunning number of <span class="caps">JSF</span> offerings.  Many vendors want to sell you their <span class="caps">ID</span>Es.  It seems the diversity in java's web framework ecosystem deters them from making web app magic happen in their tools.  &quot;Which framework should we support?&quot; they ask.  By blessing one framework the <span class="caps">IDE</span> vendors can focus their development resources on &quot;The Standard&quot;.  Just as the 1.4 logging <span class="caps">AP</span>Is threaten to replace log4j, so will <span class="caps">JSF</span> threaten <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/struts/">Struts</a>, and all the rest of the java frameworks for that matter.  Brace yourself for a tsunami of <span class="caps">JSF</span> hype.</p>

<p>In spite of the coming marketing storm, David showed off some good stuff.  I welcome one change in particular.  They borrow heavily from Struts, but have separated the concerns of site navigation from actions which change the state of the Model.  Whereas, both of these things are handled with Action configurations in Struts, in <span class="caps">JSF</span> they are separated.  In fact, the navigation configuration is yet another state transition table which will <em>declare</em> the flow through the application.  The Actions get to focus just on changes in the state of the Model.  This is one thing that I have missed from Turbine -- the navigation is separate from the actions which effect the model.  That exact separation of concerns is also present in bOP.</p>

<p>David mentioned that there are places to declare the connection between a form and an object in the model.  If he actually showed us that detail, I missed it.  But he did mention repeatedly that <span class="caps">JSF</span> uses much more declarative programming.  <a href="http://www.bivio.biz/hm/csci7818-bop-intro/what-is-bop">bivio brags about being declarative too</a>.</p>

<p>What about the View?</p>

<p><span class="caps">JSF</span> adds several stages in the life-cycle of a request.  Some of those stages are specifically added  to allow page widgets to trigger events.  It allows you to &quot;attach&quot; server-side event listeners to those page widgets.  They've done some pretty clever things to simulate a Swing-like event model while staying within the limits of <span class="caps">HTTP.  I</span>'m sad to report that <span class="caps">JSP</span> still plays a central role.  Taglibs provide some of the important hooks that help maintain the Swing-like look in the code.   It looks like it will be hard to use other templating options with <span class="caps">JSF </span>-- the functionality provided by tag libraries for <span class="caps">JSP</span> would have to be replicated in <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/velocity/">Velocity</a> or similar tools.</p>

<p>I'm not sure what to make of the move to Swingishness.  See, I've drunk deeply from the templating kool-aid.  I prefer <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/velocity/">Velocity</a> to <span class="caps">JSP</span> for various reasons I won't go into here.  When <a href="http://dobbse.net/thinair/2003/09/000138.html">I wrote a little controller in perl for New Millennium</a>, one of the key ingredients was <span class="caps">HTML</span>::Template -- it's not as cool as Velocity, but it let me separate the <span class="caps">HTML</span> from the controller.</p>

<p>Rob observes that templates make the same mistakes that old green screens did: mixing display codes with business logic and data.  At first blush that sounds like <span class="caps">JSP</span> scriptlets.  But I think Rob's assertion was more sweeping.  Whether you're writing servlets with println()s or <span class="caps">JS</span>Ps with scriptlets or concealing the scriptlets with tag libraries, there's a mixing &quot;screen control characters&quot; with logic and data.  Velocity macros don't change that mix.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.bivio.biz/vs/site_root/hm/index">In bOP they use a Tk like language</a> for defining the web pages.  To the extent that Tk and Swing are similar, so is bOP's view language similar to <span class="caps">JSF</span>'s stuff.  Looking at David's examples for <span class="caps">JSF</span> helped me get my head around bOPs stuff a little more. bOP views assemble <span class="caps">UI</span> widgets into a hierarchy.  I presume that <a href="http://www.bivio.biz/hm/csci7818-bop-intro/why-is-bop-cool">bOP's facades</a> are basically implementations of the language which render those widgets into <span class="caps">HTML.  I</span>'m making educated guesses about what's going on behind the scenes.  But I'm fascinated by the parallel development going on in <span class="caps">JSF.</span></p>

<p>My feelings are still mixed.  Rob's point about green screens is persuasive.  But I'm just not quite ready to give up templating.  Interestingly, bOP and <span class="caps">JSF</span> both seem to bring the web user interface back under the auspices of software development, perhaps taking it back from web designers.  Maybe that's appropriate for web <em>applications</em>.  It also seems like a natural progression for web apps.  The <span class="caps">GUI</span> developers have worked through a lot of <span class="caps">UI</span> and usability issues in the past twenty years.  Their toolkits look like Swing and Tk.</p>

<p><a href="http://dobbse.net/thinair/2003/09/000140.html">State machines</a> part five</p>

<p>At the September meeting of <a href="http://www.frameworks-boulder.org/">frameworks-boulder</a> Tom Vilot, an artist and a geek, presented <a href="http://www.bivio.biz/hm/download-bOP">bOP</a>.   Rob Nagler, President of <a href="http://bivio.biz/">bivio</a> also showed up.  <a href="http://vilot.com/category-list?s=1">Tom's personal website</a> has interesting artwork. (I feel obliged to mention that there's some nudity -- exercise caution if you or anyone with a view of your screen is likely to be offended.)  <a href="http://PaintedSnapshot.com/">Tom's also got an interesting business</a> that you might check out.  I enjoyed his presentation of bOP.</p>

<p>The conversation with Rob afterwards was interesting enough that I ended up missing <a href="http://boulderjug.org/">BJUG</a>.  Tom had explained that &quot;bOP is written in very lispish perl&quot;.  Rob added that it makes heavy use of closures which is part of what makes it lispish.  I also saw some use of anonymous subroutines (lambdas in lisp) in the task configuration[1].  While talking about lisp and perl Rob asked if I'd read <em>On Lisp</em>?  <a href="http://dobbse.net/thinair/2003/10/000148.html">I've been reading it slowly for the past few months</a>.  Interesting timing.  Most relevant for this conversation,  a bOP application centers around a task configuration which happens to be a state transition table.</p>

<p>My intuition is ringing pretty loudly about this framework.  I haven't worked with it at all, but while I've been looking more closely, everything I've seen aligns with all of this state machinery.  Here's part of the example <a href="http://petshop.bivio.biz/src?s=Bivio::PetShop::Agent::TaskId">bOP Pet Store task configuration</a>.</p>

</pre><p>I don't know the mechanics behind it, but I'm really interested in the lines that declare a relationship between Model and View and a given state.  It looks related to parts of <a href="http://research.sun.com/projects/ace/samples/NameTool/Nametool.aum">the Ace Application Usage Specification</a>.  Both appear to be declaring relationships between the state machine and the Model, though Ace is quite a bit more verbose.  Also, Ace is speculative research whereas bOP has been in production since 1999.</p>

<p>When I read <a href="http://dobbse.net/thinair/2003/10/000145.html">Bob Martin's chapter on the state pattern</a>, I immediately started imagining how that could be connected to a web app framework so I could get back to <a href="http://dobbse.net/thinair/2003/10/000142.html">thinking about web apps like I used to with Tango</a>.  By all initial inspection, it's already implemented in bOP, and bivio's taken further steps to make the model and security connections also declarative.  In fact, while explaining <a href="http://www.bivio.biz/hm/why-bOP">why you should consider bOP</a> bivio uses language similar to what I was saying about Tango:</p>

<blockquote><p>bOP's primary advantage is as an alternative model for web development. Application servers promote a page-centric model.  bOP's task-centric model allows you to think in terms of operations, not output (results).</p></blockquote>

<p>[1] anonymous subs are how you do closures in perl so these are probably the same thing.</p>

<p>slight diversion from <a href="http://dobbse.net/thinair/2003/09/000140.html">State machines</a></p>

<p>For my undergraduate research project I tried to create some tools to generate three dimensional computer models of buildings (or whatever) from photographs.  I used AutoLISP and let AutoCAD's graphics engine manage the user input and the display.  My mentor was <a href="http://faculty.washington.edu/mdgross/">Mark Gross</a> who among other things was an accomplished lisp hacker.  I was hoping to teach myself Common Lisp after graduation, but was discouraged when Mark observed that languages, even programming languages, are grounded in a community.  He said it would be hard to learn lisp in the absence of a lisp community.  He was right.  Before I finally admitted defeat I had bought <a href="http://allconsuming.net/item.cgi?isbn=1555580416">CLTL2</a>, Mark's suggestion, and <a href="http://allconsuming.net/item.cgi?isbn=0130305529">On Lisp</a> which I found for myself in the Fall of 1994.</p>

<p>Both books have collected dust on my bookshelf in the many years since.  Every time I've moved since then I've considered getting rid of them, but each time I've felt my stomach uncomfortably tighten up.  I couldn't do it.  For just less than a decade I have been moving them and their dust from one place to the next.</p>

<p>My recent exploration of <a href="http://roughingit.subtlehints.net/pyblosxom/">PyBlosxom</a> has rekindled my interest in lisp because of the lambdas in its callback chain.   I have been wanting to reconnect with what I used to know about functional programming, but had still not made the time.  Then I blog-hopped my way to Paul Graham's article <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/hp.html">Hackers and Painters</a>.</p>

<p>There on his site I found his page about <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/onlisp.html">On Lisp</a> .  The reviews quoted there are glowing.  I went to Amazon to get other opinions which were even more glowing.  I'm glad my intuition wouldn't let me get rid of it.  In the past month I've finally cracked it open and have been slowly ploughing my way through it.</p>

<p>It's a fairly short book, but quite dense.  I'm sure Paul would consider that flattery because he suggests that code should have just those qualities, short but dense.  The reading is slow going.  Most of the prose is brief explanations of what a code example is doing, or why you might want a utility to do that.  But understanding the code and connecting it with the prose takes time and attention.  And it's been a long time since I parsed parentheses.</p>

<p>Macros, creating languages, and other meta-programming.  The discussion of closures and functions that return functions are quite illuminating.  I've understood the <em>what</em> of closures for a long time.  <a href="http://allconsuming.net/item.cgi?isbn=0596000278">The Camel book</a> explains them pretty clearly.  But only now do I think I understand the <em>why bother</em> of closures.  They're akin to lightweight objects with only one method.  The variables closed within are encapsulated properties of the object.  Lightweight and encapsulation are Good Things.  Paul emphasizes how lisp invites the programmer to extend the language into their problem domain.  Functions and macros that generate functions and macros are powerful tools.  Another recent bloghopping session led me to <a href="http://research.sun.com/research/jtech/pubs/98-oopsla-growing.ps">Guy Steele's OOPSLA '98 inspired presentation on Growing a Language</a>.  Mark said something similar at the Sundance Lab in the early 90's: &quot;sooner or later all programs want to become their own language.&quot;</p>

<p>All those lisp hackers have been pointing me in this direction, but only with some experience under my belt can I understand the wisdom.  AutoLISP was trying to guide me in that direction too.  Toward the end of my time working with Kim Veltman, the animation tools I had developed were becoming a language.  I wasn't doing that in any intentional way.  I was just gradually removing some of the repetition in creating the animations.  As I sharpened my tools, there began to emerge an animation scripting language.</p>

<p>While developing Envoy, we were conscious of the force pulling towards a  language.  In fact we resisted that force, trying to expressly <em>not</em> write a language.  But the requirements were really begging for it.  Envoy administrators would create <em>macros</em> (think Excel macros, not lisp macros) to munge <span class="caps">CAD</span> data.  There were pre-processing macros, format conversion macros, post-processing macros, and delivery macros.  (I thought we needed a composite pattern -- macros of macros -- but was accused of more pattern zealotry).  In spite of our efforts to avoid it we joked sarcastically that we had created a not-exactly-visual, distributed batch file system, about as impoverished a language as <span class="caps">DOS.  </span>In spite of our sarcasm, it was actually pretty fun to build.  Good lessons in concurrency and messaging among other things.</p>

<p>Is all programming meta-programming, just that some things are more obviously meta- than others?  When test-firsting I write programs to test programs.  It's not quite like functions that return functions, but there's something meta- about it.  Test-driving often leads quickly to interfaces each of which is an <span class="caps">API </span>-- a micro language for communicating with an object.  That's what Guy Steele's presentation was getting at, that good programming languages encourage growth in the language.  The Ace project web site remarks that we don't write ones and zeros anymore, and very few write assembly.  It boasts of being the next logical step in that progression of abstracting away another layer of implementation details.  When <a href="http://www.denverjug.org/events/sep2003.html">Grady Booch spoke at DJUG</a> he called it increasing layers of abstraction.</p>

<p>On Lisp's theme of <em>bottom-up programming</em> is a metaphor for the profession as a whole.  Programmers grow their tools from the root elements of lisp toward a domain specific language at the same time that the system is being decomposed from high level requirements into appropriately digestible chunks.  Similarly, the programming's progression has been inside-out recursion.  Instead of working in from the outer lists down to the atoms, those who went before wrote in atoms and in each decade those elements have been wrapped it in a higher level list.</p>

<p>Heh heh heh.  I'm not even half-way through this book and I've already connected it to the programming profession as a whole.  Consider that another strong recommendation.  :)</p>

<p><a href="http://dobbse.net/thinair/2003/09/000140.html">State Machines</a> part four</p>

<p>A couple weeks ago John mentioned that Craig Larman is one of his favorite authors.  A link on <a href="http://www.craiglarman.com/">Larman's site</a>  caught my eye:  James Gosling has been working on <a href="http://research.sun.com/features/ace/">the Ace project</a>.  No particular reason for that to get my attention, but it did.  Trusting intuition I followed the link.  After lots of effusive hype about how Ace is going to make programming easier (and maybe wash your dishes too :), the page briefly explains the <em>how</em> of it:</p>

<blockquote><p>The key to the Ace technology is its mechanism for application specification.  This Ace specification has been formulated to capture the precise and complete intent of the desired application while simultaneously excluding or hiding all of the possible implementation details.</p></blockquote>

<p>I quote that paragraph mostly because it highlights that this is &quot;the key to the Ace technology&quot; and because hiding implementation details sounds remarkably similar to my description of Bob Martin's state machine compiler.  The quote goes on:</p>

<blockquote><p>The first half of an Ace specification is a description of the data which the application will manipulate, that is, its set of business objects. These business objects and their relationships are represented visually in a diagram. ...<br />
 <br />
The second half of an Ace specification is a description of how the application will manipulate that data, that is, its business process tasks. These business process tasks and their sequencing are represented visually in another diagram.</p></blockquote>

<p><a href="http://research.sun.com/features/ace/images/ace_graphic2_lg.jpg">The business process diagram for the PurchaseOrder application</a> is an unmistakable state transition diagram.</p>

<p>Given all the state machines on my brain I had to take a closer look.  <a href="http://research.sun.com/projects/ace/">Sun Labs Ace Project</a> has a more technical spin.  Have a look at this <a href="http://research.sun.com/projects/ace/samples/NameTool/Nametool.aum">Ace example code for an Application Usage Specification</a> and compare that with Bob Martin's <a href="http://dobbse.net/thinair/2003/10/000145.html">state machine compiler configuration</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://dobbse.net/thinair/2003/09/000140.html">State Machines</a> part three</p>

<p>I've recently finished reading <a href="http://allconsuming.net/item.cgi?isbn=0135974445">Agile Software Development</a> cover to cover.  I learned a ton.  I can't recommend this book strongly enough.  This goes on my list of must-haves along side <a href="http://allconsuming.net/item.cgi?isbn=0201633612">Design Patterns</a> , and <a href="http://allconsuming.net/item.cgi?isbn=0201485672">Refactoring</a> , and <a href="http://allconsuming.net/item.cgi?isbn=0201310058">Effective Java</a> .</p>

<p>Bob Martin Introduces the state pattern on page 419:</p>

<blockquote><p>Finite state automata are among the most useful abstractions in the software arsenal.  They provide a simple and elegant way to explore and define the behavior of a complex system.  They also provide a powerful implementation strategy that is easy to understand and easy to modify.  I use them at all levels of a system, from controlling the high-level <span class="caps">GUI</span> to the lowest-level communication protocols.  They are almost universally applicable.</p></blockquote>

<p>That dispelled any <a href="http://dobbse.net/thinair/2003/09/000141.html">doubts I had about all those workflows</a> .  And it gave me insight about what made <a href="http://dobbse.net/thinair/2003/10/000142.html">that Tango outline</a> effective.  Despite some tendency toward self-doubt, I trust my intuition when it gets insistent.  But confirmation by external authorities gives me a warm, fuzzy feeling inside.  :-)</p>

<p>Just as I was settling a little too deeply into my self-satisfaction, Bob mentioned his <a href="http://www.objectmentor.com/resources/downloads/index">state machine compiler, available for free at Object Mentor</a> .  It humbled me.  Create a state transition table and let the compiler pop out a bunch of state machine gears and cogs.  What an excellent example of meta-programming (about which I'll have more to say).  Moreover, a state transition table is an excellent way to think about the state pattern.  The compiler allows me to work with the state machine at a conceptual level without having to get lost in the state pattern minutia.  This is the kind of trick I just know is going to change the way I approach problems.  This is leverage.</p>

<p><em>By the way, Larry, who recommended Agile Software Development to me, has just commented about <a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0120174/categories/javaAndObjectOrientation/2003/10/01.html#a24">using state charts to design user interfaces</a> .</em></p>

<p><ins>Update:</ins>  Thought I should include an example of the <span class="caps">SMC</span> config file.  This is the state transition table for a turnstyle from the <span class="caps">SMC</span> distribution.  I think you can see at a glance how it spares you the state machine minutia.</p>

<p>Les' examples are good for discussion.  On the surface it looks like solid argument against Jeremy's suggestion.  But despite the verbosity, I think the ability to get on with the applications is the important part.  I think Jeremy's idea will grease those wheels.</p>

<p>I pushed really hard to get <a href="http://www.visionlink.org">VisionLink</a> to move off of FileMaker Pro and onto PostgreSQL, though any <span class="caps">SQL</span> database would have made me happier.  After a lot of back an forth it became clear that they were not going to budge.  It also became clear that I couldn't stand to work with FileMaker Pro any longer.  That's ultimately why I left in the Spring of 2000.  I was convinced that they were using the wrong technology and I was tired of having to work around it.  More importantly I felt stifled and claustrophobic in my professional development.  It was a pretty hard choice to make because I really liked my coworkers and really believed in the company and in the products.  I still do, actually.</p>

<p>The job with Spacial (later PlanetCAD) was all that I could have asked for professionally.  Right off the bat I was thrown into a project using <span class="caps">PHP</span> and MySQL on a linux box.  I did my development in emacs.  I introduced the use of version control for web apps.  I also spent some time helping to automate the importation of an <span class="caps">XML</span> news feed.  A little bit of cron, perl, <span class="caps">XSLT,</span> and a python module for zope.  And then they decided to move everything we were working on to Java and Oracle.  That led to <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/turbine/">Turbine</a> and other Jakarta goodies.  I couldn't ask for more...</p>

<p>... except for the fact that the company was in an irrecoverable tailspin.  In addition to all the cool technical things I learned along the way I learned many negative examples about business.  PlanetCAD had the right technology.  But it completely failed as a business.  Every decision was a foolish gamble striving to recover ten-to-one returns for the investors to make up for what they had been loosing.  Over the same period .coms were crashing all over the place.  The wreckage was profound.</p>

<p>VisionLink powered right along.  Part of that has to do with their customers.  The non-profit business ecosystem runs under different cycles than the commercial world.  I'll take a fair bit of credit for some of the technical suggestions they did adopt.  They agreed to move to an <span class="caps">ASP</span> business model.  When I started, a significant chunk of my work was managing the servers which were installed remotely at the client's <span class="caps">IS</span>Ps.  Before we began gradually pulling them back into our own house there were probably twenty-five servers I was managing through Timbuktu.  At the same time we were replacing the remote servers with our local server farm, we modified the code to work under virtual hosting -- supporting more than one community on a single piece of hardware.  With all the servers relocated it was easy to throw hardware at the problem when a community outgrew their little slice of a server.  The communities that outgrew their systems would get moved onto dedicated and spiffy new hardware.</p>

<p>But given the lessons at PlanetCAD and the accompanying hail of dot bombs, the lion's share of VisionLink's success has to go to their business savvy.  They paid careful attention to maintaining excellent customer support and building relationships with their customers.  That was a real business priority and not just rhetoric or marketing.  They kept expanding the revenue stream in sensible ways and made sure those revenues covered salaries, rent, long distance phone bills, the expense of the new hardware, and so on.  And they made exactly the right decision to not change technology when I pushed so hard for it.  The revenue stream wouldn't have supported the complete overhaul I was suggesting.  And the customers were served just fine with FileMaker Pro on the back-end and regularly expanded hardware.</p>

<p>It's too bad that my professional development needs didn't match with VisionLink's business needs.  But I'm glad we finally figured that out and went our separate ways.  I'm pretty sure we are both better off for the change.  And I'm happy for their continued success.  If you happen to be involved in workforce development efforts or education reform you should look at the tools and services they offer.  You can most definitely trust that you will be well served, and you can trust them to manage their business and not drive it into the ground.  They will definitely be there as you grow.</p>

<p><a href="http://dobbse.net/thinair/2003/09/000140.html">State Machines</a> part two</p>

<p>My life as a network administrator ended and life as a professional software developer started in 1997 when I moved back to Colorado and got a job with <a href="http://visionlink.org">VisionLink</a> .  At the time, VisionLink used Tango and FileMaker Pro on PowerMac <span class="caps">G3</span>'s for their web application (there was only one at the time).  Tango has changed hands a number of times and now goes by the name <a href="http://www.witango.com/">WiTango</a> .</p>

<p>Since leaving VisionLink I've worked with many other web application tools.  <span class="caps">PHP, </span>Zope, the ArsDigita Community Server, perl and python cgis, Turbine, Velocity, Struts, <span class="caps">JSP.  </span>Tango had one thing that all of those other technologies lack.  The development tools encouraged you to think in terms of what the whole application was going to be doing rather than thinking one page at a time.  I miss that way of thinking about web applications.  It was like having an outline of the application up front.  You still had to put the individual pages together but every page was inherently created in the context of the rest of the application.  It was easy to see the relationship of the forrest and the trees.</p>

<p>Few people have even heard of Tango, much less developed an application of any complexity with it.  It's hard to explain why it's a better way to think about the apps.  Perhaps it's similar to making the leap from simple functional programming to recursive programming, or from procedural to object programming.  Or the leap to using patterns.  (I'm sure that aspect oriented programming will open up still more options if I can ever make the time for it.)  It's all programming, but different modes of thinking about problems open up different solutions.  For a given problem some modes of thinking are more effective than others.  I think Tango had a better fit for thinking about web applications.</p>

<p>I have just recently learned to think of that &quot;outline&quot; as an application-level state machine.</p>

<p><ins>Update:</ins>  Looks like <a href="http://www.witango.com/productinfo/guide/studio.thtml">the WiTango Development Studio</a> hasn't changed radically since my Tango days.  There's a picture of the outline I've been talking about on that page.  It's a tree widget with if...else branches and such.  Those branches are at the application level, not the page level.  <em>If the user isn't logged in</em> ... <em>if action=save</em> ... and so on.  As opposed to <em>if user has x permission then show y widget</em> or other page logic.</p>

<p><a href="http://dobbse.net/thinair/2003/09/000140.html">State Machines</a> part one</p>

<p>At the heart of PlanetCAD's <span class="caps">SCS </span>Envoy was a workflow engine cast as a finite state machine.  It was responsible for managing the automated processing of <span class="caps">CAD</span> models through a farm of job servers.</p>

<p>At the time I wrote that engine I started to see workflow and state machines everywhere.  I spent some time looking at the <a href="http://cvs.apache.org/viewcvs/jakarta-commons-sandbox/workflow/">Jakarta Commons Workflow</a> in the Commons sandbox.  It was structurally similar to Envoy's workflow engine, but it was intended to operate at a completely different level -- managing multi-page forms (aka wizards) in a web application.  I was also in on some early discussions with <a href="http://blogs.werken.com/people/bob/">Bob McWhirter</a> as he was starting <a href="http://werkflow.codehaus.org/">Werkflow</a> .</p>

<p>Anyway, we were expecting to see Envoy evolve into a system that also structured some of the business workflows.  Think of how paper forms in triplicate flow through a traditional business process.   Many of the organizations which are working with three dimensional models also have heavily structured processes which might lend themselves to electronic augmentation.</p>

<p>At the time I put <em>workflows</em> into three categories.  The automated back-end processing that was happening in Envoy, the wizard interfaces in web applications, and the larger business process itself.</p>

<h3>Pattern Zealotry</h3>

<p>When I was building Envoy's workflow engine I was finally groking design patterns.  I was razzed by the other developers on the team for trying to find yet another place to use a pattern.  No question, I was intoxicated by patterns and was trying hard to shoehorn them into our system anywhere I could.  They were right to push back against my zealotry so only those patterns with solid rationale would actually make it into the system.</p>

<p>Their razzing made me seriously second guess myself about all the places I was seeing &quot;workflows&quot;.  Was it just youthful enthusiasm?  Or were there really all these different applications for workflow?</p>

<span class="title">XPath in the URL</span>

<p>I was wondering how long it would be before the dots were connected between <span class="caps">UR</span>Ls and XPaths.  I was thinking it would be a ways off yet given the <a href="http://diveintomark.org/archives/2003/01/13/semantic_obsolescence">well publicized problems with XHTML</a> .  I also expected to see the XPath after the # on the <span class="caps">URL.  </span>It seemed like the XPath should be treated as inside document.</p>

<p>Today <a href="http://weblog.infoworld.com/udell/2003/09/16.html#a797">Jon Udell pointed to Kimbro Staken's XPath-searchable blog</a></p>

<blockquote><p>I just love this idea of incorporating XPath into <span class="caps">RES</span>Tian <span class="caps">UR</span>Ls. With Kimbro's approach, you get immediate use of the markup you create -- just the kind of incentive that's needed.</p></blockquote>

<p><a href="http://www.xmldatabases.org/WK/blog/262?t=item">Kimbro's post</a> is currently not responding.  Probably slashdotted.  It could be fun to watch the blogsphere elaborate on this idea.  The immediate payback could be just the thing to drive adoption of clean-markup-and-CSS.</p>

<p><ins>Update:  Having now had a chance to browse Kimbro's post, I can't wait to see the code behind his site.  I've also been looking at PyBlosxom as a potential replacement for Movable Type.  Python, XPath and weblog sounds like a tasty recipe to me.</ins></p>

<span class="title">Scaffolding and Architecture</span>

<p>Grady Booch spoke at <a href="http://denverjug.org">Denver Java Users Group</a> tonight.  When I mentioned that to Sarah she laughed out loud.  &quot;His name is Grady Booch?&quot; she exclaimed and then laughed again!  Heartfelt, joyous laughter.  Sorry, Grady.  You may be one of The Three Amigos, but I guess you're not a household name.</p>

<p>I did explain that he was introduced as one of the few people in our industry who could be called a rock star.  Sarah thinks he's got a really funny name.  She laughed again a few minutes later when I said his name another time.</p>

<p>His presentation was entitled &quot;The Architecture of Unusual Things.&quot;  It was a fun presentation with many interesting anecdotes.  I enjoyed his stories and sense of humor.  You can <a href="http://www.denverjug.org/presentations/index.html">get the slides from DJUG's web site</a> if you'd like the details.  One of his conclusions was that architecture is a living, breathing thing which must grow or die.  It reminded me of a few of my travels in Europe.</p>

<p>I didn't get to see the Pantheon when I was in Rome.  It was quite a disappointment.  In one of my classes in college I created a three dimensional model of the interior of the dome including the coffered ceiling.  The rendering came out quite nicely, but I wanted to see what the lighting looked like in the real thing.  Unfortunately it was <a href="http://babelfish.altavista.com/babelfish/tr?urltext=chiuso+per+restauro&amp;lp=it_en">chiuso per restauro</a> .</p>

<p>Quite a few things were <em>chiuso per restauro</em> while I was in Italy.  I became quite fond of scaffolding.  I was particularly struck by the scaffolding at what I think was the chapel of St. Damian [1], a chapel which St. Francis built himself.  Around the chapel I visited had been built a baroque monstrosity.  The chapel was contained within it, below the dome at the crossing.  Those who built the big church around the little chapel seem to have completely missed St. Francis' point.  Anyway, at the time I visited there were extensive repairs underway on the dome and a vast pile of scaffolding had been constructed below the dome.  They used really beautiful black struts with substantial brass-colored joints assembled in an octet-tetra truss completely surrounding the modest jewel of a chapel.  The scaffolding was beautiful in its own right, but even more so for protecting the chapel from the dome above, indeed protecting it from the entire containing church.  I found it truly beautiful and profoundly symbolic.</p>

<p>In later travels I kept noticing the scaffolding inside or outside so many places we visited, none of it as beautiful or powerful.  Nevertheless, I imagined a time-lapse film of each of these sites, watching the scaffolding crawl spider-like around the building -- an architectural enzyme continually repairing some part of structure or facade or interior.</p>

<p>Although it is not exactly what Grady Booch was talking about, I can only agree that Architecture is a living, breathing thing.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> [1] It may also have been Santa Maria de Los Angeles as my friend Jim notes in his comment.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> Tim Bray knows what I'm talking about.  While talking about <a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2003/09/17/MovingDowntown">Antarctica's move to downtown Vancouver</a> he mentions:</p>

<blockquote><p>Yaletown was all brick buildings and fashion victims. Down here, it all happens faster and everything's under construction; oh, the geometry!</p></blockquote>

<p>He also includes a nice picture of a building under repair and the structure of the crane involved is a variation of an octet-tetra truss.  Geometry indeed.</p>

<span class="title">Sobig.F and Blaster rekindle the OS wars</span>

<p>Jon Udell offers his usual balanced opinion about <a href="http://www.infoworld.com/article/03/09/05/35OPstrategic_1.html">Security blame games.</a>  He also responded to various reactions to this article in <a href="http://weblog.infoworld.com/udell/2003/09/08.html#a793">Monoculture, competition, and security.</a><br />
I'm not quoted ;-) but many of the sentiments echo <a href="http://dobbse.net/thinair/2003/08/000132.html">my own thoughts on the matter</a>.  For example, Dan Gaters and Aaron Cohen both emphasized the advantages diversity brings to the table.  But there's one point in the original article I want to respond to.</p>

<blockquote><p>The mess we're in is largely Microsoft's fault, to be sure, but any dominant software player would have created a similar mess.</p></blockquote>

<p>Sobig.F and Blaster have rekindled the various Mac vs. <span class="caps">PC</span> debates among my friends.  I've heard this point made often in the past few weeks.  Jon is as platform agnostic as they come, so I'm really abusing his comment to launch an attack against my usual pro-Microsoft opponents.  ;-)</p>

<p>My first complaint is that it is a completely unverifiable claim.  We can't re-run the universe to see how things would be different if Apple held 95% of the desktop market, say.  It seems logically plausible that hackers would be exploiting weaknesses in Mac <span class="caps">OS,</span> but there's no way to confirm nor deny the claim.  Unverifiable claims quickly descend into religious wars with each party claiming their own unverifiable holy ground.</p>

<p>There is some anecdotal evidence to the contrary, though.  As Jon quoted, Ralph Loader observes:</p>

<blockquote><p>For web serving software, Apache is the dominant player, with Microsoft's product in a distant minority, but still dominating real life security problems.</p></blockquote>

<p>Even this counterpoint doesn't quite serve, though.  Apache's dominance of the web server market does not compare to Microsoft's dominance of the desktop market.  According to <a href="http://news.netcraft.com/archives/web_server_survey.html">Netcraft</a> Apache has about 65% of the market.  Although that's a substantial share, it's isn't the 95% we hear about for Windows desktops.[1]</p>

<p>Here's the best I can muster to counter the argument.  The world that we actually live in is not the imaginary world where hackers exploit some other dominant operating system.  We live in the one dominated by Microsoft.  I'll say it again because it bears repeating.  If you are currently suffering on Windows, you can switch to any other operating system <em>today</em> and live in happy relative isolation from the havoc of these worms and viruses.  I would naturally suggest Mac <span class="caps">OS,</span> but any non-Windows <span class="caps">OS</span> could rescue you from the pain of the Microsoft monoculture.</p>

<p>This brings me to my second point about the argument.  It sounds so self-defeated.  &quot;Yes, we Windows users have to suffer from viruses and so on.  But it wouldn't be any different if we all changed.&quot;  Who really cares if you &quot; <em>all</em> switch?&quot;  Why are <em>you</em> allowing this imaginary world stop <em>you</em> from switching <em>yourself</em> and enjoying the relative safety today? [2]</p>

<p>[1] Is that figure an urban myth?  I have scrounged Google for a quick summary of the desktop market numbers and haven't turned up anything as satisfying as Netcraft's numbers for webservers.  If you know where those numbers are, please post a comment with the url.</p>

<p>[2] To be fair, I should offer the answer I routinely get from my favorite Windows bigot.  Remote Desktop.  My friend, Jeff, is an excellent mostly-windows network admin who's network was not infected by Sobig.F nor Blaster.  Self-discipline is another viable antidote to the monoculture.  He does his backups and routinely patches the systems on his network and he also raves about Remote Desktop.  <span class="caps">X11</span> users will not be particularly impressed by it.  But there is a certain coolness factor in using a browser to initiate a remote desktop session.  And I can't dispute the utility it offers Jeff.</p>

<span class="title">How to stop the next mutation of Sobig.F</span>

<p>Mixed in with the spam bounces from <a href="http://dobbse.net/thinair/2003/08/000131.html">some vile spammer</a> I'm also getting bounces originating from Sobig F along with lots of mail with attached .pif files.  I know how to stop it.  (spread the word :-)</p>

<p>According to <a href="http://securityresponse.symantec.com/avcenter/venc/data/w32.sobig.f@mm.html">Symantec's security response for Sobig.F</a>

<blockquote><p>Sobig.F can download arbitrary files to an infected computer and execute them. The author of the worm has used this functionality to steal confidential system information and to set up spam relay servers on infected computers.</p>
 
<p>This functionality may also be used as a worm self-update feature. Under the correct conditions, Sobig.F attempts to contact one of the list of master servers, which the author of the worm controls. Then, the worm retrieves a URL that it uses to determine where to get the Trojan file, downloads the Trojan file to the local computer, and then executes it.</p></blockquote>

<p>There are 20 specific computers on the net which Sobig.F will contact to determine the URL of a file to download.  Last week the antivirus community shutdown the 20 servers before any additional damage could be done.  But it didn't take long for some bad guy to introduce <a href="http://www.infoworld.com/article/03/08/26/Time%20Warner%20Telecom%20may%20be%20next%20Sobig.F%20target%20(IDGNS)_1.html">a variant of Sobig.F</a> which addresses this weakness.</p>

<blockquote><p>The new Sobig.F variant contains an encrypted list of the names of seven servers operated by Time Warner Telecom (TWT)... Two of the servers are SMTP ... servers, ... the other five [are] apparently domain name servers.</p></blockquote>

<p>I substantially snipped that quote to draw attention to the use of SMTP and especially DNS.  The new strain no longer hard-codes the ip addresses of a finite number of servers.  Instead it's hard-coded seven domain names.  It implies there will be secondary attacks where the bad guys will crack DNS servers, or more likely Active Directory servers, so that they can control the IP addresses that are mapped to the Time Warner domain names.</p>

<p>The bad guys are breeding a virus that actively looks for mutations of itself.  That ought to scare the hell out of you.</p>

<p><strong>Here's how to stop it.</strong> Sobig is looking to download and execute code from some server.  The mutations are playing games to allow the bad guys to control where that server is.  Use their own code against them.  Change your DNS servers to point the Time Warner addresses (with my apologies to Time Warner)  to a server you control.  Put a Sobig uninstaller there and let the viruses dutifully remove themselves from the infected systems.<p>

<p><strong>That won't be the end of it.</strong>  Viruses and immune systems evolve together.  Every mutation in one creates selective pressures on the other.  This process will continue indefinitely and we are going to see some truly nasty viruses in the future.  <a href="http://weblog.infoworld.com/udell/2003/08/22.html#a779">Microsoft might now be genuinely concerned about tightening their security</a>, but the world is still going to be suffering the consequences of their many years of monopoly laziness for a long time to come.</p>

<p>The best hope we have to limit the damage future viruses can cause is to rebuild our computer world with diverse operating systems and software.  The Windows mono-culture is enormously vulnerable, both for its size and for Microsoft's past sins.  The more Windows users who switch to any other operating system the better.  We can pretty much count on the fact that not everyone is going to switch.  So there's little danger that some other OS will take Window's place.  Optimistically, if Windows were only 30% of the market with Solaris, Mac OS, Linux, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, and others splitting the rest of the market, we'd be in a much better position as far as viruses are concerned.</p>

<p>Here's an incentive to you reluctant Windows users: you can switch today and live in a much less hostile computing ecosystem.</p>

<p>My brother has been enjoying <a href="http://launch.yahoo.com/">LAUNCHcast</a> since before Yahoo! bought them.  He reminded me about it today.  After <span class="caps">DSL</span> came up I went to check it out.  How truly annoying!</p>

<p>Hello Support at <span class="caps">LAUNC</span>Hcast.</p>

<p>This service is pretty unfriendly to Mac <span class="caps">OS X</span> users.  The form for customizing a radio station cannot be submitted with either Safari 1.0 (v85) or Mozilla Firebird 0.6.  The links to existing stations claim to be &quot;Launching your radio player&quot; and never do anything.  In Internet Explorer 5.2 the custom form can be submitted.  Only with <span class="caps">IE</span> and only after completing the form do I see a message that <span class="caps">OS X</span> is not supported.</p>

<p>I filled out <a href="http://launch.yahoo.com/launchcast/setup.asp">the dang form</a> three times only to learn that I have to pay the Microsoft tax to enjoy your service.  It's a long form.  At the very least your site should notify <span class="caps">OS X</span> users <em>before they complete the form</em> that you don't support the platform.  You could also make it self-evident that your service depends on Window Media Player.  The link to the <a href="http://help.yahoo.com/help/us/launch/cast/cast-01.html">LAUNCHcast system requirements</a> it too deeply nested.</p>

<p>Thanks for wasting my time.</p>

<p>ps.  <a href="http://add.yahoo.com/fast/help/us/launch/cgi_feedback">Your feedback form</a> requires that I tell you which Windows Media Player I'm using.  Since I'm not actually using Window Media Player, please disregard that part of my reply.</p>

<p>This morning I spent some time on the phone with <a href="http://www.indra.com/about/matt.html">Matt</a> at <a href="http://www.indra.com/">Indra's Net</a> trying to get my <span class="caps">DSL</span> activated.  It didn't go smoothly, but I'm still very happy with my <span class="caps">ISP.  DSL</span> is up!</p>

<p>I like Indra's Net.  Real human beings answer the phone -- no voice menu.  Everyone I've ever spoken with has been genuinely courteous: not artificially sweetened, and not formulaic, and never rude nor impatient.  In this particular case Qwest had not scheduled my service to be installed until tomorrow.  We would have saved several phone calls if Matt had noticed that detail earlier.  I appreciate that he was honest about that mistake.  He didn't blame Qwest and didn't make any other excuses.</p>

<p>A couple hours later he made the extra effort to call me back when he noticed my line come up.  Qwest finished their work early.  Qwest gets credit too, but Matt made a point of calling me back.  In fact, it seems likely that the calls we made to Qwest moved me up their queue.  So it may not have been smooth, but I've got bandwidth a day early.</p>

<p>Yippie!</p>

<p>Dear Web Surfer,</p>

<p>Many web developers work hard to ensure that their sites function properly and look dynamite in a variety of browsers.  Unfortunately, some web browsers make the job much more difficult.  When sub-standard web browsers dominate the market, the whole web suffers.  Those who create web pages and applications must confine their designs to the weakest but most dominant browser.</p>

<p>You can help improve the situation immediately by simply choosing to use a web browser that provides better support for web standards.  Please help to re-create a competitive environment for the web.</p>

<p>Windows, Linux, MacOS X: <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/">Mozilla</a> and <a href="http://www.opera.com/">Opera</a><br />
MacOS X: <a href="http://www.apple.com/safari/">Safari</a><br />
Linux: <a href="http://www.konqueror.org/">Konqueror</a></p>

<p>Here are a couple other links to variations on this request:<br />

<a href="http://giantfightingrobots.com/betterbrowser.html"><img src="http://giantfightingrobots.com/betterbrowser.gif" alt="click here for better browsing" /></a></p>

<p><ins>update:</ins> As of November 11, 2003, <a href="http://webstandards.org/">The Web Standards Project</a> has a different view about how to make the web a better place.  <a href="http://webstandards.org/act/bug/">They recommend reporting browser bugs to the creators</a> and <a href="http://webstandards.org/act/campaign/buc/">suggest we move beyond the browser upgrade campaign</a>.</p>

<blockquote><p>Now that the playing field is more level, it is time for site builders to make more of an effort to educate themselves on ways to take advantage of the gains that have been made.</p></blockquote>

<p>I find their case fairly compelling, and share their encouragement that web designers raise the bar on their design.  Nevertheless I still maintain that you, dear web surfer, can improve matters by switching browsers today.</p>

<p>Thanks,<br />
-Eric</p>

<p>ps.  If you're a fellow web designer, please take the time to <a href="http://webstandards.org/learn/">learn some new tricks from The Web Standards Project</a>.  But please also consider adding an auto-detecting link on your pages to spread the word.

<span class="title">The Great Browser Upgrade Campaign</span>

<p>I started this project on July 3rd and then stalled on a little bit of scope creep.  I've been kicked into gear now that Tim Bray has publicly observed that <a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2003/07/17/BrowserDream">there's an opportunity to side-step the limitations of Internet Explorer</a>.  <q>We just have to figure out how to get the alternatives in front of enough of the right people</q></p>

<p>I have an idea about how to notify the masses of the better web browser options that exist.  But it will only work if the idea caches on.</p>  

<p><ins>Update 11/11/2003:</ins> <em>It hasn't.  <a href="http://webstandards.org/act/campaign/buc/">WaSP recommends moving beyond the browser upgrade campain</a>.  They seem to have shifted their focus to <a href="http://webstandards.org/learn/">getting web developers to educate themselves</a> which seems sensible enough.  I still think this idea has merit.</em></p>

<p>Exploit the deviations from standards to expose the deviant browsers.  For example, according to <a href="http://w3development.de/css/hide_css_from_browsers/summary/">this table of hiding CSS tricks</a> the following html snippet should catch most of the browsers that generally make web development painful.</p>

<pre>
&lt;style type="text/css">
  #campaign .thanks        {display: none;}
  #campaign [class=thanks] {display: inline;}
  #campaign .please        {display: inline; font-weight: bold; color: red;}
  #campaign [class=please] {display: none;}
&lt;/style>
&lt;p id="campaign">
&lt;a href="http://dobbse.net/thinair/2003/07/000123.html">
&lt;span class="thanks">Thanks for surfing with a better browser.&lt;/span>
&lt;span class="please">Please consider changing your web browser.&lt;/span>
&lt;/a>
&lt;/p>
</pre>

<p>Here it is in action:  <br />
<style type="text/css">
  #campaign .thanks        {display: none;}
  #campaign [class=thanks] {display: inline;}
  #campaign .please        {display: inline; font-weight: bold; color: red;}
  #campaign [class=please] {display: none;}
</style>
<p id="campaign">
<a href="http://dobbse.net/thinair/2003/07/000123.html">
<span class="thanks">Thanks for surfing with a better browser.</span>
<span class="please">Please consider changing your web browser.</span>
</a>
</p>

<p><ins>Update 11/11/2003</ins> simplified the HTML and CSS for clarity.</p>

<p>There are some ingredients which could help the idea spread more easily.  There is some existing buzz to fill the sails a bit:  Tim's post mentioned earlier and <a href="http://simon.incutio.com/archive/2003/08/03/marketingFirebird">Simon's discussion about marketing Firebird</a>.  My example is pretty simple and follows Tim's <a href="http://www.intertwingly.net/blog/1427.html">view source lesson</a>.  Could the idea catch on?  Would <em>you</em> add an adaptive link like this one to your blog?</p>

<p>It would probably be better if the link pointed to a wiki so that the web design community as a whole could maintain the message to J. Random Surfer over time.  That is precisely the self-imposed scope creep that kept me from posting this earlier.  I thought I would host a wiki just for that purpose.  I may still, if the idea catches on, unless someone else beats me to it.  I'm not particular about exactly what words are used in the message to the user, just that it be polite and use standard CSS (or whatever) to auto-detect lame browsers.  I also think it will bet better accepted by J. Random if it doesn't single out Internet Explorer.</p>

<p>Spread the word or tell me why you think it won't work</p>

<p><ins>Update 11/11/2003:</ins> <em>WaSP mentions one key complaint about where their browser upgrade campaign fell short: earlier campaign techniques</em> "became an easy out for site builders who didn't want to bother with testing their sites in browsers like Netscape 4, even if they were not concerned with the use of standards based markup." <em>There's also some well-deserved and fairly widespread distain for the "best viewed in Browser X" badges which litter the 'Net.</em></p>

<p><em>My suggestion probably isn't much of an improvement over the browser badges.  But it does have the virtue of thanking those who are using better browsers.  One could remove the 'thanks' part have self-concealing web litter only visible for those using lame browsers.  I especially like that there is nothing fancy going on.  No browser sniffing nor redirection, just leveraging some CSS support to encourage better CSS support.  CSS2 selectors hide the 'thanks' message and reveal the 'please' message.  CSS3 selectors reverse that.  Compliant browsers will prefer the CSS3 settings.  Painfully simple and view-source friendly.  Ah, well.  Tough to push a tipping point alone.</em></p>

<p>I enjoyed the following <a href="http://www.denverpost.com">Denver Post</a> article which was sent to the <a href="http://comug.com">COMUG</a> Misc mailing list.  <a href="http://www.denverpost.com/Stories/0,1413,36~78~1505610,00.html">Artists turn tables on the major labels by going indie</a>.  It looks like the artists won't need <a href="http://dobbse.net/thinair/2003/07/000116.html">iTunes and the Apple Store</a> after all.</p>

<p>A brief summary of the article follows, 'cos I understand that the Post articles drop behind a paywall like the New York Times.</p>

<p>Tangent:  I wonder if the permalinks meme will enter the consciousness of the journalism industry.  It seems likely that journalists will begin to go independent like the musicians mentioned in the Post article, rather than depend on newspapers to market their content.  Will they implement pay walls in their web logs, or will some other payment scheme emerge?  Am I'm confusing free content with permanent links, or is there something important about making the content available freely?  I kinda like the model <a href="http://salon.com">Salon</a> uses for premium content -- leave a lengthy first page freely available behind a permanent link, and ask readers to subscribe, pay-per-view, or watch an ad.</p>

<p>The article mentions several artists whose names you probably know and quotes several others directly.  The gist of it is that the big five music publishers shafted some veteran artists who weren't selling in large enough volume, so they've chosen to create their own labels or release their music through smaller labels.  In the case of the Eagles, it sounds like they just decided it was in their economic interest to remove the middle man.  Their case is thematic for the article:  musicians don't really need a big label to market their music anymore.  They can establish their own small market through a web site and maybe through some internet radio stations, and they can produce their own disks and keep their masters to themselves.</p>

<p>Artists mentioned:  Pearl Jam, Natalie Merchant, Jimmy Buffett, the Eagles, Boston, Richard Thompson, Fairport Convention, David Lindley, Kaleidoscope, El Rayo-X, Prince, and Boz Scaggs.</p>

<p>My little summary probably doesn't do the article justice.  There are lots of fun quotes in there from the artists.  It's worth a read, but I also wanted to insulate my own post from potential link-rot.</p>

<p>I've been sitting on this thought for weeks now.  I find <em>the idea</em> of iTunes and the AppleStore exciting.  I have been considering the potential links between .mac, iTunes, and the AppleStore.  I see the seeds of a market place for independent art.  Many creative professionals are already Apple enthusiasts.  It's insanely easy to publish digital creations with .mac: just drag it to your iDisk, connect it to your web page.  iTunes points the way to connecting a media player to a media source allowing money to exchange hands.  Just connect a few more dots.</p>

<p>Let all the media players be connected to the AppleStore in some fashion.  Let .mac subscribers move their creations into a ForSale folder on their iDisk.  Let those ForSale items be purchased and downloaded through the AppleStore, and directly through the media applications included on all Apple computers.  Somehow the money collected at the AppleStore needs to find its way into the artist's hands.</p>

<p>On the surface it sounds like a great democratization of artistic creation.  That comes with all sorts of pros and cons, but on balance I think it will be excellent.  Looking a little more deeply, does it scare you to think of Apple (or any corporation) at the center of that kind of market place?  If Microsoft were to beat Apple to it, would it scare you to think of Microsoft at the center?</p>

<p>In the long run, most of those connections are trivially easy.  But there are all sorts of nasty legal and political issues to slow our progress from here to there.  We are in for an interesting ride.</p>

<span class="title">Road steering the car</span>

<p>This is the product of a daydream on a road trip to my parent's place over the weekend.</p>

<p>Once <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=RFID" title="RFID">radio frequency identification </a> [1] chips are cheap enough to throw away with a cereal box, they could be embedded in roads, maybe as part of the line painting process.  Like pheromones for ants they could tell the car where the road is.  The <span class="caps">RFI</span>Ds might need to be mapped and inventoried while the lines are painted.  The paint truck could use a combination of <span class="caps">GPS</span> and wireless networking to record the coordinates of each <span class="caps">RFID</span> as they are laid into the road.  There would probably need to be a certain density of IDs to account for individual unit failures over time.</p>

<p>The cars would periodically ping the <span class="caps">RFI</span>Ds and correlate those with built-in <span class="caps">GPS</span> and a local cache of the <span class="caps">RFID</span>-GPS database and adjust its course and velocity as appropriate for the approaching turns and hills.  Cars would probably need to have <span class="caps">RFI</span>Ds or some other wireless tag so each car would know where other cars were.[2]</p>

<p>Obviously this doesn't solve the whole problem.  Colorado Highway 6 occasionally gets closed in the winter because of avalanches.  The degree of wetness and temperature of snow radically changes road conditions.  Perhaps more important, the type of tires and amount of wear hugely influences traction in even modest weather.  Weather might also interfere with the wireless communications.  Deer and foxes and raccoons don't generally come equipped with <span class="caps">RFI</span>Ds, but are known to cross paths with automobiles.  Potholes or miscellaneous road debris probably wouldn't show up in the database.  And the snowplows clearing the roads in winter, or spreading sand or deicing liquids could trash the network of <span class="caps">RFI</span>Ds.  In short, reality is radically messier than a pleasant geeky daydream.  But it hints at the kinds of cool things that we haven't seen yet and seemed worth blogging.</p>

<p>Of course, the most important part is that people probably don't want cars that steer themselves.  For example, it would take all the fun out of sports cars.</p>

<p>[1] My wife, Sarah, suggests that acronyms should be banned.  If people were forced to actually speak the words instead of the initials or acronyms, we might end up with sensible names for things.</p>

<p>[2] Of course tagged cars opens the privacy can-o-worms, too.</p>

<span class="title">Would digital identity for mail servers cut down on spam?</span>

<p>The spam thread came up on the <a href="http://comug.com/">COMUG</a> <span class="caps">OS X</span> developer's mailing list recently.  The thread started with a question about what programmers were doing about their spam.  I've been meaning to post this idea for more than a week.</p>

<p>I'm definitely seeing a big increase in spam these days.  Yesterday was a new high of 100 or so junk mails in 24 hrs.  (I don't want to sound too impressed with myself.  This is only half what CmdrTaco was getting <a href="http://www.hardwareanalysis.com/content/article/1547/">last October</a>.)  Until recently, I've been happily relying on Mail.app to catch the junk.  I've recently started a contract where I'm working in Windows and I'm now having to wade through spam from work.</p>

<p>I generally don't throw away my spam because I want the raw materials in case I ever re-install the <span class="caps">OS </span>(or get that new PowerBook I ordered) and need to re-train Mail.app.  If I had the time, I'd hook a baysean spam filter to my procmail filters.  <a href="http://spambayes.sourceforge.net/">SpamBayes</a> looks interesting because I like python and Indra's net has python installed.  The advantages of server-side spam filter are compelling -- most importantly benefiting from the spam filter regardless of the computer or mail client in use.  The disadvantage is that I'll have to pay attention to my disk quotas on the server so I don't start bouncing mail because of my collection of spam.  It's easy enough to schedule a script to periodically zip and ship my spam collection home, but writing that script has to compete for time with all my other pet projects.</p>

<p>That's how I'll deal with spam myself when time permits.  In the meantime I'm suffering at work.</p>

<p>Let me run an idea past you.  What if reputable <span class="caps">IS</span>Ps electronically signed messages sent from their servers, and only stored or forwarded mail similarly signed?  If mail servers have to certify their identity, then spammers would have to expose themselves -- opening them up for slashdot effects or denial of service attacks.  What holes do you see in this idea?  Would it be worth lobbying the programmers of sendmail and qmail?</p>

<p>Others have suggested digital identity among individuals as a good solution for spam because spammers depend on anonymity.  The barier of educating all email users about digital identity is prohibitive, and there are good reasons why some email users want to maintain anonymity.  Would you agree that most <span class="caps">IS</span>Ps and those writing mail servers are technically clueful enough to deal with the complexities of digital identity?</p>

<span class="title">Test driving IDEA </span>

<p>The pun is intentional.  While I have been getting acquainted with the code I am taking over for my new contract, I have also taken advantage of the the trial license for <span class="caps">IDEA.  </span>The app is using Struts in JBoss, both of which are new to me.  You can expect to see some Struts-Turbine comparisons as I get more familiar.</p>

<p>Today I started <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?TestDrivenProgramming">test-driving</a> some new code in the data access object.</p>

<p>My very first impression of Struts this week was frustrating.  Hunting from the struts-config.xml to the objects and <span class="caps">JS</span>Ps annoyed me.  At some point I will probably grok the need for the extra layers of indirection.  This week it just bugged me.  And then I installed <span class="caps">IDEA.</span></p>

<p>I learned regular expressions from <span class="caps">BB</span>Edit and quickly became an evangelist for both.  In the past three years, I have become an emacs junkie.  I've never been impressed with any <span class="caps">IDE,</span> always returning to the comfort of the all-mighty text editor.  I've read plenty of accolades for <span class="caps">IDEA,</span> but remained skeptical.  In the first ten minutes, after setting up the project, I was ready to spend the money.</p>

<p>Setting up the project was intuitive.  I didn't read the docs at all -- and didn't even notice that until I started writing about it today.  I read through a few tips-du-jour and left it on.  <span class="caps">I </span><em>never</em> do that!  The tips are entirely relevant.</p>

<p>What I noticed first was the todos extracted from the comments in the code.  Not a wiz-bang thing, but incredibly and immediately useful.  (Contrast that with the <span class="caps">MS </span>Paperclip.)</p>

<p>Next I noticed the local version control.  I first used <span class="caps">CVS</span> for a safety net in my hobby projects.  I have missed that since I joined Turbine and learned to never commit if it doesn't compile.  In the back of my mind I have occasionally toyed with trying a local repository in conjunction with the real thing, I have chosen to just do without.  I had forgotten about it until I saw the feature in <span class="caps">IDEA.  I</span> immediately had to see the diff and rollbacks in action.  How totally excellent!</p>

<p>Most importantly, in these few days I haven't found any annoyances.  That never happens!  Preferences have been easy to find.  Keyboard access for everything is excellent.  Ubiquitous name completion and JUnit integration are also excellent.  I love having the &quot;grammar checker&quot; warn me about the syntax errors <em>before</em> I compile.  My only challenge is training my fingers new keystrokes.</p>

<p>Back to Struts, <span class="caps">IDEA</span> was immediately useful in loading classes by name while looking at struts-config.xml.  It took away the nuisance of the indirection.  I realize now that this is one of the critical services offered by an <span class="caps">IDE</span>:  making layers of indirection easy to navigate.</p>

<p>I know the refactoring goodies are cool, but fluidly navigating the code is what facilitates the understanding that comes before code changes.</p>

<p><span class="caps">IDEA</span> rocks!</p>

<p>Charles <a href="http://fishbowl.pastiche.org/archives/001289.html">reports</a> that Mail.app only catches 20% of his spam.  It catches about 80% of mine.  Maybe the filtering database has gotten fowled somehow.</p>

<p>The success rate varies for me.  For a while base64 encoded html attachments were getting through.  But I dutifully flagged them as junk and Mail seems to be catching them more consistently.  In some recent mutations spammers are *M *E *S *S *I *N *G with words in the subject line and adding random noise fdxciqwea.</p>

<p>The virus mutates.  The new strain is virulent until the antibodies in the population develop and correct the imbalance.  The pattern is the same whether the virus is SARS, or CodeRed, or <a href="http://www.npr.org/about/sponsors/myth.html">the NPR funding hoax</a>.</p>

<p>The first Mail.app preference I turned off was 'Display images and embedded objects in HTML messages'.  Hit counts for links to images provide spammers with immediate feedback about which mutations are surviving spam filters in the wild.  Unfortunately, there are enough mail clients providing that feedback that the spammers can breed the mutations which are most effective at evading filters.</p>

<p>Now if only I could get a bayesian filter installed on my snail-mailbox.</p>

<p>I don't know who to cuss at!  I was working merrily away on a reply to Charles Miller's post about the Mail.app spam filter.  I was nearly done, just editing for brevity when BAM!  The window disappears.  "What did I just do?"  I checked through all open windows.  Nope.  My reply to Charles was gone.  Data lossage always sucks.  But what did I do?  (Please find the link to Charles' post in my <a href="http://dobbse.net/thinair/2003/04/000101.html">rewritten reply</a>.  Grumble.)</p>

<p>I was typing into a &lt;textarea> in Safari in Movable Type's New Entry form.  One thing I like about Safari is I no longer have to cut-and-paste in order to check my spelling.</p>

<p>But then I hit the keystroke to copy some text.  You know the one.  Command-W.</p>

<p>The mac user asks  "doncha mean Command-C?"   The emacs user asks "doncha mean Meta-W?"  If you use both, maybe you know my pain.</p>

<p>For those of you who don't:  The Quartz window manager maps the Command key to Meta.  So the Meta-W keystroke, which copies a block of text in XEmacs, is Command-W on an Apple keyboard.  And Command-W is the keystroke which closes windows in MacOS.  My fingers don't always make the transition from XEmacs key bindings to MacOS key bindings when I switch between apps.</p>

<p>If I had been using any text editor instead of a damn web browser to compose my reply I would have been prompted to save my work before closing it.  But Safari merrily closed the damn window when I told it to.</p>

<p>I think I'll file that as a feature request:  please make Safari smart enough to recognize a web form.  Identify the window as unsaved if text is edited in any of the fields.  Prompt the user for confirmation before closing a window containing an unsaved form.</p>

<p>But I will probably also go back to composing my blog entries in emacs and cut-and-paste them into Movable Type's form.  If I get really ambitious I'll write an emacs module to submit new entries.  Naw.  Who am I kidding?  It would be easier to switch to blosxom and just upload the entries.</p>

I have no idea if the one I concocted will conflict with Safari's ID generation.  Also, I had to quit and re-launch Safari for the bookmark to show up in the UI.</p>

<p>I've landed a contract programming gig.  One of the guys I'm working with is fresh out of college with a CS degree.  He seems to be a pretty good programmer, but inexperience and haste showed in the perl cgis he'd hacked together.  On Thursday afternoon I gave him a quick explanation of how to do objects in Perl.  He went home and spent four hours rewriting his CGIs into objects.</p>

<p>Three years ago at this time I couldn't figure out how to apply OO Perl to my own projects.  Partly, my one-shot data munjings didn't really need objects.  I knew how to use modules slurped from CPAN and I understood the syntax, and inheritance, encapsulation, polymorphism and so on.  I <em>understood</em> but I didn't <em>grok</em>.</p>

<p>Sometime between then and Thursday I grokked.</p>

<p>It tickles me to think that two years of Java and five months of occasional python hacking have helped me grok OO Perl.  Maybe I shouldn't be publicly bragging about it.  :-)  It's also fun to have a paid perl gig.</p>

Support HTTP GET-style URLs. Design them carefully, matching de facto standards where they exist. Keep the URLs short, so people can easily understand, modify, and trade them. Establish a blog reputation. Use the blog network to promote the service and enable users of the service to self-organize. It all adds up to a recipe for recombinant growth.</blockquote></p>

I was inspired by Chris Winters' recent post, <a href="http://www.cwinters.com/News/show/?news_id=279">Getting good</a>, and decided to just start somewhere on <a href="http://dobbse.net/reflection/2002/09/000057.html#svg-animations">SVG animations</a>.  I also plan to play with <a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0112098/2002/10/30.html#a217">Being architecture neutral</a>.</p>

<p>I spent a couple days trying to remember and re-learn some linear algebra and matrices.  It's been a long time since I've done anything more complicated mathematically than balance my checkbook.  The geometry of perspective comes naturally to me.  I'm stunned by how much more work I had to expend in order to calculate the point of intersection between two lines algebraically.  Google pointed me to <a href="http://astronomy.swin.edu.au/~pbourke/geometry/lineline2d/">a solution</a>, but I wanted to make sure I understood the math myself.</p>

<p>When I did this before, I used the (inters ...) function in AutoLISP.  Therefore, my previous code was not much use.  It will start to come in handy as I get further along.  Now that I've got a function to calculate the intersection between two lines I can get on with the more interesting parts of the problem.</p>

<p>For many years I felt like a sub-standard geek because I preferred Macs to PCs and faced routine static for it.   I lived with LinuxPPC for a while, but never felt satisfied by any of the Linux desktops.  For the record, I've been wanting to see this OS take off commercially since the first time I saw a <a href="http://www.blackholeinc.com/specials/blackhardware.shtml#NC">big black NeXT cube</a>.  In fact, I bought a Mac Cube in spite of it being overpriced when OSX beta became generally available.  There was nostalgic value in the allusion to that NeXT cube.  Name the company lead by Steve Jobs selling a cube shaped computer running a BSD-based OS with a sexy GUI on top offering a CD-RW drive and no floppy disk.  Maybe the most successful skunkworks operation ever.</p>

<p>When Bob asked about <a href="http://blogs.werken.com/people/bob/archives/000107.html#000107">Planning and Scheduling</a>, this sentence got my attention:<br />
<blockquote>I'm thinking along the lines of werkflow being use to drive your typical web-app, where you have almost enough database connections, etc.</blockquote></p>

<p>It looks like <a href="http://dobbse.net/reflection/2002/09/000057.html#werkflow-valves">one of the projects</a> I would like to pursue:<br />
<blockquote>Experiment with using Werkflow in place of the valves in Turbine 3.</blockquote></p>

<p>Bob's specific example of "almost enough database connections" made me think about definining rules to manage graceful &#65279;degradation of service under increasing load.</p>

<p>So much fun stuff to learn, so little time.</p>

<p>Once you get used to the fact that you "can" understand the inner working of your base tools and modify and debug them (more or less) freely, you will never want to use a non-free equivalent again. And I'm speaking as a system integrator here.</blockquote></p>

<p>I think software development is evolving into something like the traditional professions.  Any two architects practice the same design.  Not that they design the same things, but they are engaged in the same practice.  Both are constrained by their building materials, budget, zoning, and context.  Similarly doctors practice the same medicine, lawyers the same law, bankers the same finance.  The professions are fundamentally about providing services.  When you pay a lawer to review a contract, you are paying for their expertise and knowledge of contract law.  You're not paying for the law itself.  Similarly, you don't pay your doctors for the medical research that forms the basis of their evaluations of your medical condition.</p>

<p>The profession of software development will become dominated by integration of open source components with limited development to satisfy unique requirements of specialized applications.  The common general requirements will be met by open source components.  Some developers will specialize into specific areas of development, where others will be "general practitioners".  Developers will make their money lending to their customers their expertise and mastery of available open source components and services to solve technical problems for the customer.  It's only a question of time.  But I'll know I was right when you have to pass a certification exam before you can call yourself a software developer.  :-)</p>

<p>A couple technology veterans are spreading memes about platforms.</p>

<p>Daniel Steinberg summarizes some key points of Tim O'Reilly's keynote at the O'Reilly Mac OS X Conference:</p>

<blockquote>O'Reilly's final lesson was one also learned from Microsoft, "a platform beats an application every time. AppleScript matters because you get a virtuous circle of hacker innovation." As you develop applications, think about what it means to be a platform. Create hooks so that other people can write to it. Think about extensibility and interoperability when you create an application. He advised developers to think of their applications as "network and open applications. Play well with others and have fun."</blockquote> [<a href="http://www.macdevcenter.com/pub/a/mac/2002/10/03/keynotes.html">Why Unix Matters to Mac OS X</a>]

<span class="title">Aggrigation and Bloghopping</span>

<p>I've been bloghopping all day.  I keep stepping away from the keyboard, shaking my head about the time I've poured away.  Each time I asked myself, <em>"Self, what were you supposed to be doing again?"</em>  The original goal was to try to identify some blogs to aggrigate.  Early this morning I managed to get the <a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/~rael/lang/perl/blagg/downloads/plugins/mt.pl">Movable Type plugin</a> working with <a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/~rael/lang/perl/blagg/">Blagg</a>.  That turned out to be a <a href="/thinair/000020.html#000020">simple adjustment to mt.cfg</a>.</p>

<p>Cool beans, I can now aggrigate blogs.  But I immediately noticed that the aggrigated entries all had today's date, undermining some of the cool navigational instrumentation offered by Movable Type.  So I dug into the code for Blagg and <a href="http://www.movabletype.org/">Movable Type</a> to see if I could pull the dates from the RSS feeds and use those in the MT entries.  I ran directly into the <a href="http://weblog.infoworld.com/udell/2002/09/10.html#a408">RSS morass</a>.  Now I understand what all the fuss is about.<br />
<em></p>

<p>   "Self, what do we do now?"</p>

<p>   "RUN, COWARD!"<br />
</em></p>

<p>Rather than joing the RSS battle, I decided that a little patience and judicious use of cron would let me enjoy Movable Type's instrumentation in my aggrigator.  If I aggrigate the feeds daily, they'll be sufficiently in sync for my purposes.  Only this first pull will be hosed.</p>

<p>That's what I did this morning.  Then I decided to figure out which blogs I want to aggrigate.  That's where the Energizer Rabbit started bloghopping.  And kept going and going and...</p>

<span class="title">changes in Apple's market</span>

<p>I attended the <a href="http://comug.com/">Colorado Mac Users Group</a> OS X meeting last night for the first time.  The first presentation was observations from a couple guys who attended the Seybold conference.  A presentation about why <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/jaguar/rendezvous.html">Rendezvous</a> rocks.  The short story is it's easier than AppleTalk, isn't chatty, and leans on completely open technology.  A review of why changes in Darwin are important to even the non-geeks.  It was a long list, but the thing I liked best: the simple addition of Ruby, Python, and the aquafied Tcl/Tk opens MacOS to 30,000 programs from the Linux world.</p>

<p>Anyway, the first presentation is the purpose of this entry.  It seems the Graphic Arts industry is not switching to OS X.  The consensus in the industry seems to be that, contrary to what Apple would have you believe, OS 9 is still the world's best graphic arts platform.  For small outfits, or individual designers who mostly need to push Photoshop and Illustrator around, OS X is fine.  But for the businesses that are running production printing operations, OS X isn't there yet.</p>

<p>In particular they cited "font madness", the lack of printer and scanner drivers, the lack of plugins for Quark and Photoshop as the largest contributing factors.  The cost of upgrading was also cited, but seen as trivial in comparison.</p>

<p>Their impression is that the graphic arts industry looks a bit like a "deer in the headlights" at the moment.  It's clear that the change to OS X will be painful and expensive.  They seem to be supressing a question in the back of their minds: "is it time to change to Windows?"</p>

<p>In contrast to this there's Tim O'Reilly's article about <a href="http://www.macdevcenter.com/lpt/a/2657"> Mac OS X Switchers</a>.  A lot of <a href="http://www.macdevcenter.com/pub/a/mac/2002/05/14/oreilly_wwdc_keynote.html"> alpha geeks</a> are coming to appreciate the Apple community's long focus on the real power of ease of use (as opposed to the power of MHz and good shells).  When most things "just work" it leaves a lot more time for hacking on the fun stuff.</p>

<p>It'll be interesting to see how Apple adapts to a changing user base.</p>

<p>Many years ago (1991 or 1992, maybe), early in my exposure to the 'Net, I was surfing Gopher sites and found myself pulling documents from a computer in Europe.  That's when I first groked the power of the 'Net.  Some time after that I described the 'Net to friends and family as a nervous system for the planet, where the people on the other side of the computers were neurons and the computers and networks were the synaptic links between brains.</p>

<p>In the early days of the Web everyone was using the "Information Superhighway" as the metaphor of choice for the 'Net.  That describes what the network packets are doing, but it doesn't describe what the people receiving those packets are doing.  I tried hard to get friends and family to think in terms of the people who were being connected by these computers, and not about what the packets were doing.  I shuddered at the ugly imagery in early ISP marketing: "your onramp to the information superhighway."  In retrospect, I'm not sure why greymatter should be more attractive than highways.  Maybe because it's organic?  Anyway, seems I independently found myself talking about a noosphere.</p>

<p>Tim Berners-Lee has persuaded me that <a href="http://www.w3.org/Provider/Style/URI.html">Cool URIs don't change</a>.  He advises that URIs be designed without classification or categoriztion information.  Those groupings are likely to change over time which will work against the goal of stable URIs.  In contrast, in <a href="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/pracintgr/">Practial Internet Groupware</a>, <a href="http://weblog.infoworld.com/udell/">Jon Udell</a> suggests that the URI is prime real estate for metadata.  Although Jon makes an excellent case for the value of meta data in the URI, I favor Tim's advice in this case.  The meta data will change over time.  I decided to sacrifice the use of that prime real estate in favor of the stability of the URI over time.</p>

<p>Given <a href="http://www.movabletype.org/">Movable Type</a> as my chosen publishing system, I had a few other constraints within which to work.  Both Tim and Jon recommend including the creation date in the URI.  It's valuable meta data and it won't change over time.  However, Movable Type generates the permanent entries with a serial number and not a creation date.  I lost more meta data, but protected against changes in the calendar system  as <a href="http://www.decimaltime.org/">some have proposed</a>. :-)</p>

<p>The default paths for blogs in Movable Type steered me in the wrong direction at first.  By default the indexes go in <code>www.your-site.com/</code> and the permanent archives go in <code>www.your-site.com/archives/</code>.  That makes for longer permanent urls.  I wanted something that was more like Jacob Nielsen's Alertbox:  http://www.useit.com/alertbox/20010204.html.  I also liked the suggestion from Tim to put the recent stuff behind a foo/recent/ URI.  Fortunately, Movable Type allows for this sort of organization, it just isn't suggested by default.  The organization of Jacob's Alertbox suggested I should come up with a column name for my blog.</p>

<p>It took surprisingly many variations to finally settle on putting the indexes in <code>dobbse.net/</code>, and the permanent archive in <code>dobbse.net/thinair/</code>.</p>

<p>Edit: I was wrong about limitations imposed by Movable Type.  I found this comment while bloghopping:  <em>(like Movable Type, where your archive URLs can just be named by the title of the entry, or the date, etc)</em> <a href="http://www.stupidfool.org/archives/2002/09/000213.shtml#000213">Stupid Fool: Complexity of Implementation</a></p>

<p>Edit: After learning how to control the naming of permanent links in Movable Type, I broke the rule about not changing urls.  This site has only been live for a couple weeks, and from the stats I get back from the web host, I'm almost the only one hitting the site right now.  I won't have another chance to make this change without breaking links.  So I put monthly archives in <code>/thinair/yyyy/mm/index.html</code> and permanent links in <code>/thinair/yyyy/mm/0000id.html</code>.  I don't think that even on a busy day I'll post so many items that I'll need to separate posts by day (like this: <code>/thinair/yyyy/mm/dd/0000id.html</code>), so I chose to keep the urls a few characters shorter.</p>
