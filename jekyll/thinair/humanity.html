<p><a href="http://diveintomark.org/">DiveIntoMark</a> is a continual source of fun anecdotes to show Sarah.  He wins points for a good, sometimes self-deprecating, sense of humor, quotes from Winnie <em>ther</em> Pooh, and recent talk about babies.  I like the added mix of zork, math and general geekiness.  Today <a href="http://diveintomark.org/archives/2003/12/03/cantor-sets">Mark has posted a story about the Cantor set, Sierpinski carpet, and Menger sponge</a>.  Sarah will not be amused, but I am.  The ensuing discussion about various shapes of infinity has prompted me to publish <a href="http://dobbse.net/reflection/2003/12/000157.html">the Vanishing Point animation</a> I have been working on for the past several months.</p>

<p>When I was in fifth grade (age 10ish) there was a wooden cone at school sliced into three pieces that revealed three conic sections: circle, ellipse, and parabola.  At the time I was curious to know what the relationship was between the slope of the intersecting plane relative to the axis of the cone and the resulting conic section.  I didn't have the vocabulary to articulate it that way at the time, but that's what I wanted to know.</p>

<p>I have always loved geometry (fun and interesting) and tolerated algebra (boring).  On the high-school geometry final exam (age 15ish), the instructor informed us that the final proof on the test required at least fourteen steps -- if you had less you had it wrong.  I solved the proof in seven steps.  I had finished the test about twenty minutes early and had plenty of time to double-check my work.  I finally asked the instructor to go over my solution and he agreed that my solution was correct.</p>

<p>Fast forward to college.  I enrolled in Calculus <span class="caps">III</span> as an elective even though it wasn't part of the architectural requirements.  I was specificall looking forward to formally answering that question about cones and intersecting planes (finally).  They were using the same text book as Calc <span class="caps">II</span> and the next couple chapters covered three-dimensional geometry.</p>

<p>One of the first things out of the instructor's mouth was &quot;We're going to skip the chapters on three-dimensional geometry because it really isn't very interesting.  Instead we'll jump straight into infinite series.&quot;</p>

<p>Bastard.</p>

<p>I tried to study those chapters on my own and couldn't quickly figure out how to apply the knowledge to answer my question.  While I was trying, I managed to answer the question by inspection and gave up on the calculations.</p>

<p>There are two lines of interest: the axis and the edge of the cone.  A circle is easy.  The intersecting plane must be perpendicular to the axis of the cone.  An ellipse is a generalization of a circle.  The plane must intersect both edges of the cone.  To create a parabola, the intersecting plane must be parallel to one of the edges.  And for a hyperbola the plane must be somewhere in the range between the edges of the cone.  I'm ignoring some edge cases (pun is intentional).  Planes which intersect at the point of the cone generate a point.  And Planes which intersect at the tangency generate lines.  Perhaps that means that points and lines should be included in the family of conic sections. :-)</p>

<p>(yet another addition to my growing list of things to animate :)</p>

<p>Over the weekend Sarah and I rented Winged Migration.  Wings and migration are themes in my <a href="http://dobbse.net/reflection/2002/10/000044.html">dream encyclopedia</a>.  The film feels like a step in the direction of what I was imagining.  I was reminded of my early correspondence with Kim Veltman when I first articulated that dream.</p>

<p>I awoke early this morning and began catching up on my bloghopping.  <a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0110772/2003/11/26.html#a1273">Seb bought my attention to an article by Valdis Krebs</a> : <a href="http://www.hr.com/hrcom/general/pf.cfm?oID=5635CFB8-953A-4776-AAD8B1E1404DC46F">What's Your Google Number?</a>.  To get a sense of it I googled for &quot;Eric Dobbs&quot; AND Veltman and found myself re-reading some of Kim's articles.</p>

<p>Veltman's got an ambitious goal: the restructuring of the whole of human knowledge.  He's entirely serious about it.</p>

<p>From <a href="http://www.mmi.unimaas.nl/people/Veltman/Sums/hbegan.html">How it all began</a></p>

<blockquote><p>As I reflected on the magnitude of what I had experienced I was overwhelmed by a sense of sadness and near despair. I had just had an incredible trip. I had seen more culture and civilization in three months than many persons in a lifetime. I had seen the great centres of Greek, Roman, and Hittite civilization. They were all in ruins. It wasn't as if there were just one or two sites that had fallen into a slight state of disrepair. They were ruins in the truest sense. My sadness and despair came from thinking: if this is how civilization treats its highlights, the best it has to offer, what hope is there for civilization?<br />
 <br />
Spirit<br />
 <br />
It took me a decade to find a tentative answer. The highlights of civilization which I had seen, the temples at Selinunte, Agrigento, Ephesus; the colosseums at Arles and El-Djem; the theatres at Epidaurus, Segesta, Taormina and Aspendos were all physical manifestations of social customs and spiritual ideals. There is the spirit and the flesh. There is the human spirit and there are objects, which are expressions of this spirit. As the spirit evolves, the expressions change and the earlier expressions are reduced to being merely objects and are thus neglected and forgotten. The Roman custom of combat made colosseums necessary. But there was something fairly primitive in a custom that included feeding Christians and slaves to lions. So when the customs improved, the buildings of the old customs were neglected. Ultimately they became ruins because the ideas, the ideals, the spirit behind them was no more. And while they continue to have an historical value in reminding us of what once was, the real challenge lies elsewhere, focussing on the spirit rather than its expression, the soul of culture not its skin, the dreams. If the dreams are right, if the spirit has a true vision then the buildings, the monuments will follow. The monuments are not the civilization. They are merely expressions of a spirit and will crumble the moment the spirit moves on. Gradually the quest became to find the spirit of civilization, or rather to cultivate a spirit that could lead civilization in new directions.<br />
 <br />
....<br />
 <br />
Learning is one of the most fascinating aspects of culture and civilization. There is inevitably a tendency to learn about ourselves but not about others. Anyone who was not a Greek was a barbarian. The Romans built Hadrian&#8217;s wall to keep the so-called barbarians from Scotland at bay. The Chinese built a wall around their culture for similar reasons. Yet the memorable civilizations have been precisely those which transcended that limitation. Aristotle became one of the greatest persons of all time because he commissioned his best student, Alexander the Great, to help him learn about things in Persia, India and wherever he went. The library at Alexandria tried to collect learning from all known cultures. Arabic culture became great when a caliph at Gundishapur sent emissaries to the west to collect Greek and Roman culture. Today, the Vatican, Herzog August Bibliothek, British Library, Biblioth&egrave;que Nationale de la France, and Library of Congress are the greatest libraries of the world precisely because they did not limit themselves to learning only about their own culture.</p></blockquote>

<p>These thoughts churned as I walked to the bus station.  I wondered about the size of the gap between analog and digital knowledge.  As a computer geek it's easy to fall under the illusion that everything interesting or relevant can be found with Google and persistence.  But I suspect those five libraries hold vastly more knowledge, and vastly more important knowledge than anything Google can scour with its spiders.  As we charge toward digital and away from analog knowledge, how much will we leave behind?</p>

<p><a href="http://fishbowl.pastiche.org/2003/11/28/ethereal_memory">Charles Miller blogged about Etherial Memory</a></p>

<blockquote><p>I am increasingly finding that the Internet is my swap-space. I've stopped remembering &quot;things&quot;, and started keeping a catalogue of references to things. If I find I need the information, I have enough recollection of where to find it that I can access the Internet and swap it back into main memory. Luckily, I have a really good associative memory for context, which helps me come up with the Google search I need to track down data I've otherwise swapped out.</p></blockquote>

<p>This sentiment is remarkably similar to lessons I learned by osmosis while working with Veltman.  For millennia, scholars have been teaching the next generation of scholars how to navigate libraries and museums and how to document one's travels for future generations.</p>

<p>What we computer geeks are doing is mostly abandoning that legacy and reinventing it in digital form.  Libraries are driven by meta-data.  There are many, many systems to categorize books.  In the <span class="caps">US</span> we use Library of Congress or Dewey.  There are dictionaries to help one learn the terminology and jargon of different fields.  There are indexes of major works.  Bibliographies.  Footnotes.  Secondary literature.  Encyclopedia.  Meta-data by the ton.  Veltman would like to encapsulate the millennia of scholarly meta-data navigation skills into a tool for the common man.</p>

<p>Juxtaposition</p>

<p>These thoughts were turning over in my mind.  About a block away I noticed a fire truck turning into the bus station.  Moments later I saw the express bus I was hoping to catch leaving the station in an unusual direction.  As I approached I could see the fire fighters hosing down the bus's usual exit.  The driver of the slow bus to Denver explained that someone had jumped off the top of the parking garage to their death.  Thinking about what they were cleaning off the pavement sent a shudder down my spine.</p>

<p>I've been thinking about suicide and terrorists a lot lately.  My instincts tell me that our fight against terrorism is completely backwards.  Israel offers a continuing demonstration that force is ineffective in stopping enemies who are willing to kill themselves to make their point.  I've heard the rumors about how Palestinian suicide bombers are considered martyrs and somehow earn points for their families in heaven.  But humans have strong survival instincts.  Suicide requires more than just a holy purpose -- in order to override their survival instinct people have to be deeply despaired and more scared of living than they are of dying.  Adding violence on top of violence only increases the despair.  It would be more effective to find ways to foster hope and reasons to live.</p>

<p>The <em>plate 'o shrimp</em> phenomenon from <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0087995/quotes">Repo Man</a></p>

<blockquote><p>Miller : A lot o' people don't realize what's really going on. They view life as a bunch o' unconnected incidents 'n things. They don't realize that there's this, like, lattice o' coincidence that lays on top o' everything. Give you an example; show you what I mean: suppose you're thinkin' about a plate o' shrimp. Suddenly someone'll say, like, plate, or shrimp, or plate o' shrimp out of the blue, no explanation. No point in lookin' for one, either. It's all part of a cosmic unconsciousness. <br />
 <br />
Otto : You eat a lot of acid, Miller, back in the hippie days?</p></blockquote>

<p>I like to pay attention to coincidence.  If I notice a connection between otherwise random events, then there's something in that connection to examine more closely.  Not necessarily because of a cosmic unconsciousness, it's probably all just randomness.  But if my brain draws a connection, then there's something inside me that establishes a relationship between those events.  It's like a window into my subconscious.  For me, coincidence, d&eacute;ja vu, and intuitive zaps are all things that make me examine my experience more closely to see what pattern my brain is trying to draw to my attention.  I have never been disappointed by the results of such reflection.  And if there does happen to be a lattice 'o coincidence that lays on top o' everything, at least I'll be paying attention to what's really going on.  ;)</p>

<p>I first saw Repo Man as a class requirement for &quot;Psychology of Architecture&quot; (pronounced &quot;psycho architecture&quot;) which had earned a reputation for aggressive mind games (hence the pronunciation).  I thrived in that class and came back as a teaching assistant for a couple semesters.  Among the other required movies were <a href="http://us.imdb.com/title/tt0076299/">The Last Wave</a> , <a href="http://us.imdb.com/title/tt0096895/">Batman</a> , <a href="http://us.imdb.com/title/tt0092117/">True Stories</a> , <a href="http://us.imdb.com/title/tt0083658/">Blade Runner</a> , and the 1984 colorized restoration of <a href="http://us.imdb.com/title/tt0017136/">Metropolis</a> .  That collection of movies was part of the appeal of the class for me.</p>

<p>In early August 2001, Sarah went back to Maine to celebrate her brother's birthday as she often does.  Meg, her very good friend from high school was also visiting.  In addition to her aunts and their families and her grandparents, Sarah's got many surrogate parents in Maine -- mostly her Mom's good friends.  That Summer, Sarah and I had been talking about marriage.  As it happens Meg and Joe had been too.  Largely on Meg's initiative, Sarah and Meg conducted a fairly thorough survey of Sarah's extended family and surrogate parents about marriage.  She came back with all sorts of advice and perspective.  We kept talking, with much more perspective, but she was really no more decided about the issue than before.</p>

<p>At 7:03am <span class="caps">MDT</span> on September 11, 2001 United Airlines flight 175 hit the south tower of the World Trade Center -- self-evident proof that this atrocity was no accident.</p>

<p>That evening we were cuddling on the couch in fairly stunned silence.  At some point I said &quot;Well, we've talked about pretty much everything except death.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Okay,&quot; Sarah replied, &quot;what about death?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well...&quot; I really couldn't think of very much to say.  &quot;I am five years older than you.  ... And a man.  If we do get married and it turns out to be until death do us part, odds are pretty good that I'll be the first to die.&quot;  As I remember it now, we sat again in silence for quite a while.</p>

<p>Finally Sarah replied: &quot;I don't want to wait any longer to start our life together.&quot;</p>

<p>I get to enjoy that ray of sunshine on this gloomy day.  Maybe even for the rest of my life.</p>

<p>Master: What is this I hold before you in my hand?</p>

<p>Apprentice: It is a staff, Master.</p>

<p>Master: Correct.  But wrong.  (whap) <em>hits the apprentice on the arm</em></p>

<p>Apprentice: Ouch!</p>

<p>Master: What is this I hold before you in my hand?</p>

<p>Apprentice: It is four feet long and made of wood, Master.</p>

<p>Master: Correct.  But wrong.  (whap) <em>hits the apprentice on the thigh</em></p>

<p>Apprentice: Ouch!</p>

<p>Master: What is this I hold before you in my hand?</p>

<p>Apprentice: It is a walking stick, carved from the limb of an ancient tree and given to you by your Master.</p>

<p>Master: Correct.  But wrong.  (whap) <em>hits the apprentice on the arm</em></p>

<p>Apprentice: Ouch!</p>

<p>Master: What is this I hold before you in my hand?</p>

<p>Apprentice: It is a collection of molecules, atomic particles, and sub-atomic particles bound together by various energies and wielded as used to aid walking or as a weapon.</p>

<p>Master: Correct.  But wrong.  (whap) <em>sweeps the legs out from under the Apprentice</em> (thud)</p>

<p>Apprentice: Ouch! <em>gets back on his feet</em></p>

<p>Master: What is this I hold before you in my hand?</p>

<p>Apprentice: It is an extension of your body, Master.</p>

<p>Master: Correct.  But wrong.  (whoosh)</p>

<p>Apprentice: <em>ducks the master's shot to the head</em></p>

<p>Master: Excellent!  What is this I hold before you in my hand?</p>

<p>Apprentice: Painful, Master.</p>

<p>Master: Correct.  But wrong.  (whoosh)</p>

<p>Apprentice: <em>jumps over a sweeping attack at the legs</em></p>

<p>Master: Excellent!  What is this I hold before you in my hand?</p>

<p>Apprentice: I do not know, Master.</p>

<p>Master: Then you must study it more closely.  <em>hands it to the Apprentice and exits</em></p>

<p>No description or label can capture the wholeness of the instrument held in the master's hand.  Words are a flashlight in a dark cavern.  They illuminate one small spot and cast the rest into shadow.</p>

<p>A few weeks ago, Sarah and I were talking about our respective days when she suddenly changed the subject.  &quot;Oh!&quot;  By her facial expression I could tell she was remembering something fun.  &quot;What do you think about wikis?&quot;  She asked with a mischievous grin, catching me completely by surprise.  She was pretty proud of herself for springing something unquestionably geeky that she didn't hear about first from me.  She'd heard <a href="http://discover.npr.org/features/feature.jhtml?wfId=1344426">an article about wikis on All Things Considered</a>.  I told her a little about <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?WardCunningham">Ward Cunningham</a> and the <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki">c2 wiki</a> and connected a few dots to past conversations about <a href="http://www.extremeprogramming.org/">Extreme Programming</a>.</p>

<p>Last night, I was telling Sarah about a new requirement I learned about at work.  She nodded knowingly and with a gleam said &quot;dontcha just hate scope creep?&quot;  I keep telling her that she's got geek potential, but she coyly denies it.</p>

<p>This weekend we're celebrating our first anniversary.  It's been a turbulent year.  We honeymooned in Nova Scotia. Shortly after our return I was laid off from PlanetCAD. She nearly abandoned but ultimately finished her masters thesis in December, thanks in large part to organizational and motivational help from her friend Emily.  We spent a couple weeks in New Zealand in February with her mom, brother and sister-in-law -- thanks Mom!  It's hard to believe this is the first I've blogged that.  The <span class="caps">US</span> invaded Iraq.  After seven months of unemployment, I landed a contract with the City and County of Denver in April.  Just this month, renewal of that contract has been held up by predictable delays under the city's new administration.  We've just moved back into my condo.  It is really too small for us but radically less expensive than the place we were renting.  Ellie, Sarah's sweet pit bull, has to move because the home owners association forbids dogs.  They've kindly granted a two week exception while we make other arrangements.  Someday soon we'll be looking for a house with a yard so Ellie can move back.</p>

<p>Happily, through all of these external stresses we've nourished each other and our relationship in all sorts of wonderful ways.  How completely blessed I am!</p>

<span class="title">War and Fear</span>

<p>I opposed invasion of Iraq.  But it is not enough to oppose war.  Opposition served the hawks' agenda more than the doves'.  Unfortunately, war is very hard to ignore.  My time could have been much better spent contributing something to the world.  But my conscience compelled me to present alternatives and to <a href="http://dobbse.net/thinair/2003/03/000091.html">challenge the rhetoric that rationalized violence</a>.  But I just contributed to the struggle and fed the underlying conflict that ultimately led to war.  I have been trying to write something about war and peace since at least February.  Writing about war has come easily.  Writing about peace has not.  I finally need to just publish something to get started.  Hopefully it will provoke conversation about peace.  I'm not an A-list blogger, so I'd appreciate it if you would point people to my post about <a href="http://dobbse.net/reflection/2003/07/000119.html">how fear leads to war</a> or add comments with links to where others are seriously discussing the mechanics of peace so I can get in on the conversation.</p>

<p>War is an emergent phenomenon which depends on rampant spread of fear.  For example, consider the recent invasion of Iraq.  For more than a decade we Americans knew that Saddam Hussein was a despotic ruler oppressing the Iraqi people with all sorts of brutality and nastiness.  But we weren't afraid of him.  He represented no threat to us.  And as a nation we didn't exhibit much concern for the Iraqi's all those years.  We certainly didn't show any signs of sending in armored divisions.  By contrast in the past two years weapons of mass destruction entered the American consciousness and suddenly we were terrified.  An epidemic of fear spread through this country and it became urgent that Saddam be removed from power by whatever means necessary.  We couldn't wait for weapons inspections.  Individual <span class="caps">US</span> citizens were scared of a leader of a third world country -- more scared of Saddam and unseen weapons than of loosing the lives of American soldiers in armed conflict.  War emerged as a plausible option only after a majority of the American people were more afraid of Saddam remaining in power than we were of loosing American lives in war.  How on Earth did we get here?</p>

<p>Please take a closer look at <a href="http://dobbse.net/reflection/2003/07/000119.html">how fear leads to war</a> and help me understand how to break the cycle.</p>

<p>I have been under four different health insurance policies in the last twelve months.  Now I'm officially angry.  Last week I found out my allergist isn't part of the new plan and they won't pay for my current prescription.  Today I found out my dentist isn't part of the new dental plan.</p>

<p>The notion of managed care is swell, until a change in plan changes your physicians.  Those changes are determined by the employer and not by the patient.</p>

<p>I want health care that's decoupled from employment.  The current system is interfering with my healthcare.</p>

<p>I would prefer to be part of a city-wide policy because my doctors and I are all very likely to remain in the same city.  Whereas changes in employers are like the changes in the weather.  Colorado small businesses have repeatedly asked for help with the cost of providing health insurance to their employees.  I would love to see something which solves both problems.</p>

<p><a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0070666">This movie</a> has been kinda haunting me for the past week.  Sarah and I rented it several weekends ago.  It is based on the true story of Frank Serpico, a cop of remarkable integrity who blew the whistle on rampant corruption in NYPD in 1970.  The movie portrays NYPD like the mob, spending most of their time shaking down criminals for hush money.</p>

<p>It's an excellent movie, but it is the real story which I find sobering.  As recently as 1970 the integrity of the NYPD was thoroughly compromised by payoffs.  Even the highest ranking public officials turned a blind eye to the problem rather than risk the damage to the image of the department.  Image was preferred over substance.  It's now obvious to me that I've been deeply naive about police work.  It has made corruption into something real for me, not just speculation.</p>

<p>A couple years ago this country was agitated about chads and ballots in Florida.  And until the war drums started beating there was a ton of press about Enron and WorldCom.  I first noticed the war drums around this time last year, the same time that questions were asked about business practices at the former companies of Bush and Cheney.  I sarcastically predicted to Sarah that we would be at war with Iraq in time for the elections.  I was progressively more disturbed by how close I was to being right.  Then I was shocked and frustrated by how well the war drums effected the elections.</p>

<p>It's all frustratingly conspicuous, but more frustrating because, like any good conspiracy theory, it's completely unverifiable.  All suspicion, all circumstance, all compelling but vaporous.</p>

<p>Serpico doesn't have anything to do with all of this.  It's an excellent movie that I happened to see when too much of my attention was wrapped up in a war and in my mistrust of the Administration that started it.</p>

<span class="title">Reservations about this tipping point in Iraq</span>

<p>I'm sincerely happy for the Iraqi people <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/Iraq/Story/0,2763,932957,00.html">who are celebrating in Baghdad today</a>.  This war has gripped me with very mixed emotions.  Even as I have opposed US military action, I have been unable to imagine a convincing non-violent way to remove Saddam Hussein from power.  I don't object to the ends, but I do object to the means.  I wish Gandhi could comment on it.</p>

<p>Google pointed me to some quotes from Gandhi that articulate my concerns about the use of violence even for as noble a cause as liberation from tyranny.  Both quotes are from Gandhi's thoughts on <a href="http://www.mkgandhi.org/nonviolence/phil7.htm">violence and terrorism</a></p>

<blockquote cite="http://www.mkgandhi.org/nonviolence/phil7.htm"> I object to violence because, when it appears to do good, the good is only temporary; the evil it does is permanent.</blockquote>

<p>A perfect example of long-term consequences of violence, this war was precipitated by the US support for Iraq in their war with Iran, who were supported by the Soviets.  The US and USSR waged war with each other through these middle eastern countries.  Iraq and Iran had their own animosity, but their conflict was fueled by the super powers.  In our fear of communism we armed Iraq with the very weapons which originally motivated our present invasion.  The Iraqi blood Saddam has spilled is also on our hands, not Saddam's alone.  Perhaps this is a long overdue correction to the imbalances created in our protracted cold war with the Soviets.  But that isn't the spin we get from the White House.  Instead we get a Hollywood-style spin, ironically, with the US wearing white hats and Saddam and his sons in black hats. Good propaganda is true, but simplistic and one-sided.  Even as the Iraqi's celebrate, I believe strongly that violent solutions create as many problems as they solve.</p>

<blockquote cite="http://www.mkgandhi.org/nonviolence/phil7.htm"> It is an unshakable faith with me that a cause suffers exactly to the extent that it is supported by violence. I say this in spite of appearances to the contrary. If I kill a man who obstructs me, I may experience a sense of false security. But the security will be short-lived. For I shall not have dealt with the root cause. In due course, other men will surely rise to obstruct me. My business, therefore, is not to kill the man or men who obstruct me, but to discover the cause that impels them to obstruct me and deal with it.</blockquote>

<p>More conflicting emotions.  I'm sincerely happy for the Iraqi people and optimistic about their future.  But I wonder about the repercussions of preemptive and violent overthrow of a foreign dictator.  It's like a code smell that I can't quite identify.  I'm fairly sure the violence has something to do with it.  It's a <a href="http://c2.com/cgi-bin/wiki?BigBallOfMud">big ball of mud</a> that I don't know how to refactor.</p>

<ins><p>Update:  My earlier <a href="http://dobbse.net/thinair/2003/03/000091.html">letter to the White House</a> provoked an interesting conversation on this subject</p></ins>

<span class="title">Capital punishment and Operation Iraqi Freedom</span>

<p>Bush is known to be proud of the number of people executed in Texas under his governance.  He's a strong believer in the death penalty.  This war in Iraq is politically analogous to an execution.  Saddam Hussein's regime is depicted in criminal violation of UN resolution 1441 and images of decapitation are used to describe objectives of undermining the Iraqi leadership.  Those witnessing this metaphorical execution will experience 'shock and awe' of the US Military power.  Just as the death penalty is intended to discourage capital crimes, so too this action is intended publicly to discourage Iraqi soldiers from participating in the crimes of their leaders. But clearly there is another agenda of discouraging other "rogue states" from offering terrorists safe haven within their borders, and discouraging any nation from threatening the US in any fashion.</p>

<p>But what threat does the death penalty represent for a suicide bomber, or suicide airline pilot, as the case may be?  When life has become such a burden that an explosive death is preferable, the death penalty offers no influence.  When the leaders of a rogue state know that they are on death row, will they prefer to go out with a bang or with a whisper?</p>

Classic postcard morning for the first day of Spring here in Boulder.

<p>Unfortunately, I-70 is still closed west of Morrison.  Although, with that much snow, it's probably good that I can't ski myself into an avalanche.  Occasionally -- it seemed more frequent when I was younger -- Mother Nature reminds Colorado residents to just chill out for a couple days.  I think blizzards are more gentile than earthquakes, tornados, floods, or hurricanes, but no less awesome and humbling.</p>

<span class="title">A sad day</span>

<p>Thanks, Chris, for <a href="http://www.cwinters.com/News/show/?news_id=865">pointing</a> to Edward W. Lempinen's article <a href="http://www.salon.com/opinion/feature/2003/03/19/left/index.html">See no evil</a>.  Lempinen offers compellingly written arguments in favor of the war.  I'm grateful for his reframing of the war into less offensive terms, and for suggesting a course of action for the political left: <blockquote>For those leftists who have supported the war, and for those who have loudly opposed it, now is the time for a shift in strategy. Bush and his inner circle have repeatedly gone on the record describing the war on Iraq as a war of liberation. Even if we do not believe them, we must work relentlessly to hold them accountable. We must insist that the U.S. and its allies implement, as quickly as possible, a constructive post-war plan.</blockquote>  Nevertheless, the beginning of any war is a very sad day.  And I remain selfishly concerned that US attention should be directed at al Qaeda and securing the homeland, as <a href="http://dobbse.net/thinair/2003/03/000091.html">I said earlier</a>.</p>

<span class="title">Leave Iraq to the UN, focus on al Qaeda</span>

<p>Even if you disagree with my position on Iraq, please voice your opinion to our leaders and to your own communities.  Democracy is a participatory activity.  Please speak up.*  <blockquote>To <a href="mailto:president@whitehouse.gov">President Bush</a>, <a href="mailto:vice.president@whitehouse.gov">Vice President Cheney</a>, <a title="www.congress.org's contact form for Colorado's congressional delegates" href="http://www.congress.org/congressorg/mail/compose/?opt-out=0&target=NH&target=NS&state=CO&qstate=CO&mailid=custom">Representative Udall, Senator <br />
Allard, and Senator Campbell</a>.</p>

<p>I strongly oppose war with Iraq.  Although Iraq could eventually become a <br />
threat to the United States, they present no immediate danger to our <br />
country.  By contrast, al Qaeda has demonstrated their capacity and will <br />
to deeply harm us.  Let the United Nations pursue more aggressive <br />
inspections which appear to be gradually working.  Let our nation's <br />
attention focus on our real enemy: al Qaeda.</p>

<p>The alleged links between Iraqi leadership and al Qaeda do not make any <br />
sense.  If common faith and hatred of the United States were enough to <br />
bring them together, why are the Arab nations so internally divided?  On <br />
the contrary, Osama bin Laden would loose all credibility within al Qaeda <br />
if he were to collaborate with Saddam Hussein.  He couldn't condemn the <br />
Saudis for their abuse of power while collaborating with Hussein.  It just <br />
does not make any sense.</p>

<p>It does not make financial sense either.  Economic insecurity is the most <br />
immediate threat to American well being -- far more than anything Iraq <br />
could muster.  Please do not throw away billions of taxpayer dollars to <br />
invade a second-rate threat.  Spend those taxpayer dollars strengthening <br />
our internal defenses and disrupting al Qaeda.</p>

<p>Nor does it make sense strategically.  Since January of 2002 US foreign <br />
policy has focused on the "Axis of Evil": Iraq, Iran, and North Korea.  <br />
With our intelligence attention and resources stretched so thin we are <br />
still vulnerable to attacks from al Qaeda.  The new Department of Homeland <br />
Security has a mammoth task just in re-organizing the operations of <br />
twenty-two agencies.  They cannot possibly be effective in securing the <br />
country within the apparent timetables for war with Iraq.  It doesn't make <br />
sense to wage war half way across the world while leaving our homeland <br />
defenses in their current state.  We know for a fact that al Qaeda can hit <br />
us at home.</p>

<p>Our military supremacy does not mean we can capture Hussein, or more <br />
importantly, secure all of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction.  We leveled <br />
Afghanistan and yet failed to capture bin Laden.  Moreover, Hussein's <br />
dictatorship keeps the internal Iraqi factions in check.  How can we keep <br />
factions within Iraq from slipping away with whatever weapons remain?  Let <br />
Hussein continue to keep the factions in check and let the weapons <br />
inspectors continue to scour Iraq.  Redirect our military's attention to <br />
al Qaeda.</p>

<p>Our real enemies are the sour economy and al Qaeda.  It is a grave mistake <br />
to distract ourselves in a war with Iraq.</blockquote></p>

As <a href="http://dobbse.net/thinair/2003/01/000082.html"> I also mentioned yesterday</a>, I've been chewing on thoughts about the role of a local militia in post-9/11 national defense.  My original idea was somewhat fanciful: to rally efforts among local martial arts schools to prepare to defend the local community.  But realistically, a terrorist attack would be difficult to defend even by the community under immediate attack.  The meme needed some metamorphosis.

Several items give me little confidence in the federal government's ability to prevent future attacks.  The US campaign in Afghanistan has failed to bring Bin Laden to justice.  Our leadership's attention is divided between military pressure on Iraq and diplomatic pressure on North Korea.  The herculean re-organization for the Department of Homeland Security will take a very long time.  And Israel's example demonstrates the limits of the use of force and intelligence to weaken the cells which support suicide bombers.  (Apologies to the Palestinians who surely see themselves as revolutionaries, not terrorists.)

But what can I do about it?

Terrorist attacks are like computer failures.  You don't know when or where they'll happen, but they will happen.  Technical experience offers some wisdom for dealing with unpredictable but nearly certain failures:  disaster recovery.

That was the recombination the meme needed.

Jefferson believed that citizens guarantee their rights by their civic virtue.  <cite>Gary Hart</cite> observes that <q cite="http://www.oup-usa.org/isbn/0195155866.html">"no public service more immediately and vividly demonstrates civic virtue than the citizen's defense of the homeland ....

It seems that some of Jefferson's worst fears have come true.  We (in the US) live in a representative democracy where the leaders are very distant from the citizens and policy is largely determined by "interests".  We citizens have lost a sense of civic responsibility.  We may complain to friends about foreign policy, the economy, corporate scandals, or campaign finance abuses, but vanishingly few of us bring our concerns to the direct attention of our representatives.  Instead, we surrender our influence to pollsters and lobbyists.  Many even refuse to vote as an act of protest.  How can silence be an effective form of protest?

A few points resonate.

A fundamental disagreement between the Founders centered on the nature of human kind.  Where Jefferson feared tyranny under a centralized authority, Hamilton feared tyranny of mob rule.  That fundamental disagreement seems to be imbedded in the American psyche.  We distrust our government in equal measure to our distrust of the masses.

Civil rights are guaranteed by <em> civic duty </em>.  It is not enough to know your rights.  You must take action to ensure their protection.  This is a fundamental failure of my public education.  Not until now have I appreciated how important it is to communicate with federal, state, and local government representatives.  Nor until now have I appreciated how important it is to the common good that I form opinions and defend them openly.

Silence is not a form of participation.

The question of scale was critical to the structure of the American government.  Even at its founding the nation was too large for individual citizens to be involved in every decision.  Elected representation was a brilliant solution to the problem of participating in a large scale republic.  But perhaps because Jefferson was in Paris at the time, the question of direct participation by citizens in their <em> local </em> government was not addressed by the Constitution.

In the back of my mind as I've read this book, I've given some thought to the governance of Apache projects.  It is those who commit their code, those who vote, those who submit patches who determine the direction of the community and its tools.  Those who take action are in charge.  There is a manifest sense of responsibility to the community.  It isn't exactly Jefferson's ideal.  But there are strong similarities in the connection between responsibilities and rights.  Online communities are faced with the same questions about scale, representation, participation, duty, and education.

One last note.  Looks like Gary Hart now has <a href="http://www.garyhartnews.com/hart/">a web site</a>.  In this post I've neglected to mention much about national security.  I suspect that topic will find its own coverage.  Also, I haven't finished chewing on my thoughts about a renewed emphasis on a local militia.]]>"

<p>This will be a fun experiment.  By blogging my resolutions now, next year I will be able to look back and see how I did.</p>

<p><span class="title">More quick blog entries</span>, less worrying about whether my blog is Important and Interesting.  I've been missing the point of blogging.  Too much focus on what I think Someone Else will think is interesting.  Instead I want to focus on what interests me and let Someone Else decide for herself if she agrees.</p>

<p><span class="title">Miscellaneous blog chores.</span>  Upgrade Movable Type, publish my blogroll<del>, make RSS feeds validate, make a full-content RSS feed for aggregators</del>.  Some template and CSS improvements.  'Nuff said.</p>

<p><ins>Update: <a href="http://dobbse.net/thinair/2003/02/000086.html">RSS feeds validate</a> and <a href="http://dobbse.net/thinair/2003/02/000089.html">also include full contents.</a></ins></p>

<p><span class="title">Be kinder to myself.</span>  In several conversations with Sarah over the holidays, it has become clear that I have totally unrealistic expectations of myself.  I like that I haven't lost my youthful enthusiasm and the belief that I can change the world, but self-doubt (also known as fear) has twisted that belief into an <em>expectation</em>.  There's no evidence I can provide The Angry Management that I am "meeting or exceeding expectations."  Self-doubt twists into self-abuse for failure to change the world.  That particular twist is incredibly self-destructive and incredibly arrogant.  Sarah said something like this: "Honey, I love you.  But you need to get over yourself."  It was much more compassionate than it reads.  To be kinder to myself, I will release the arrogant expectations and judgmental self-abuse and re-emphasize the <em>belief</em> in self.</p>

<p><span class="title">Spend more time with people.</span>  Dance regularly.  Go to the dojo more consistently.  Attend the local user groups: COMUG, XP-Denver, BJUG.  Ski with friends.  Participate in some of the Boulder Food Co-op community activities.</p>

<p><span class="title">Take a more active role in my communities.</span> Do a presentation for one of the user groups.  More work on Turbine.  Help with Aikido Summer Camp in the Rockies.  I subscribed to community@apache.org on Saturday.  More quick blog entries.</p>

<p><span class="title">I also got a head start on some of this year's resolutions.</span>  I bought another ski pass and have had more early season skiing than in any previous ski season I can remember.  Sarah and I joined the food coop yesterday.  I've been going to the user groups for several months.</p>

<p>Time will tell how well I adhere to these resolutions.  :-)</p>

<span class="title">An act of kindness-to-self</span>

<p>Here are some resolutions I accomplished this year.  I can't remember if they were New Year's Resolutions or just little "r" resolutions, but they are accomplishments.<br />
    <ul><br />
      <li>Married Sarah.</li><br />
      <li>Skied enough to make season pass a very good bargain.</li><br />
      <li>Nailed all three release dates at work.</li><br />
      <li>Learned, advocated, and taught several XP's practices.  Planning Game, Short Releases, Metaphor, Simple Design, Collective Ownership, Continuous Integration, and Coding Standards all helped us meet the deadlines.  It's also a measure of my success in leading the team to experiment with those practices.  Our QA Manager and I were consistently Testing, I was unit testing, he was acceptance testing.  I tried Refactoring.  But I couldn't persuade the rest of the team to adopt those practices nor Pair Programming.  We practiced a 45-hour or 50-hour Week.  We continually suffered from too little communication with our over-stretched Product Manager, the closest we could get to an On-site Customer.</li><br />
      <li>Rode the bus to work most weeks.  That was my little contribution to several causes: reducing Denver's Brown Cloud, reducing the US reliance on petroleum, reducing my own consumption.</li><br />
      <li>Decided to sell my car to contribute more.</li><br />
      <li>Actually sold it. :-)</li><br />
      <li>Made a habit of buying mostly organic food.</li><br />
      <li>Stopped eating most meals at restaurants.</li><br />
      <li>Shopped at the farmer's market.</li><br />
      <li>Spent more of my money at locally owned businesses.</li><br />
      <li>Reused more, recycled more, and threw away less.  Bought products in larger volumes or in bulk to reduce the amount of packaging I bought in the first place.</li><br />
    </ul></p>

<p>This would never happen with a phone book.</p>

<p>I received an email today from <a href="http://www.freemode.net/archives/00000006.html">a guy named Eric Dobbs</a>.  It was a little surreal to find email from myself in the inbox.  Apparently from Virginia, it seems we share some common interests -- unix, RPGs, hiking, and video games.</p>

<p>He was Googling for another Eric Dobbs in the Richmond area.  At the moment, I've got the first five hits at <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=eric+dobbs">http://www.google.com/search?q=eric+dobbs</a>.  The first is for thinair, second and third from back in the days when I was a MacPerl zealot, and the fourth and fifth are archived threads from turbine-dev@jakarta.apache.org.  The next few are posts on ZDNet by the Richmond Eric Dobbs.</p>

<p>I don't feel like I've been doing enough in the world to justify the first five listings on Google.  It's kinda fun, but mostly it makes me suspicious of PageRank.</p>

<p>A curious side effect of the 'Net and blogs.  I seriously doubt Eric would have called me if he'd found my name (or should I say his name) in the phone book.</p>

<p>Much fear in the world, I sense.</p>
