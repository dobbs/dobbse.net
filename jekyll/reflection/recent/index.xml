      <title>Dream Encyclopedia</title>
      <description>In the late nineteen eighties, I day-dreamed a very cool animated encyclopedia.  
&lt;em&gt;I'm looking at a photo-realistic animation of a falcon in flight.  I'm able to adjust the camera position to observe the falcon's movement from various angles and to zoom in on details like the tail feathers, or wing tips.  In an adjacent window pane I can see a larger view of the falcon in the context of its flight.  The window panes are synchronized so that I can see how the adjustments in the tail feathers effect the flight path in the more distant view.&lt;/em&gt;</description>
